### Software Manager ###

Fast! This is the best word to describe the Software Manager in this release of Linux Mint. A nice thing that everyone will like is that this Software Manager uses less memory than before and applications can now show multiple screenshots. Fast to **search**, fast to **start**.

### System Improvements ###

Do you use the terminal for performing your daily tasks in your Linux Mint machine? Cool, Linux Mint 16 Petra Cinnamon Edition offers a better terminal experience than before and it includes “ll” as an alias to “ls -al”. Why do “ls -al” when you can just do “ll” and be faster than ever while listing files in the working directory?

Linux Mint 16 Petra Cinnamon Edition thinks about **gamers** too! It now offers better support to Steam and its addition in the repositories and the featured section of the Software Manager.

What about **privacy**? Linux Mint 16 offers additional private/secure search engines for you guys that take secure browsing very seriously.

Better help support, safer kernel updates, faster boot sequence and faster login. What about apple fans? Yes, **apple**. We are linux guys, but sharing and caring is the most important thing to us. Linux Mint 16 includes out of the box support for iOS devices, this will make apple fans very happy.
