Modern terminal Final Term adds multiple-terminals per-window support
================================================================================
[Final Term][1] is a modern terminal application that centers exciting capabilities and handy features into a beautiful interface, Final Term presenting itself as a significant advancement for the terminal metaphor.

Smart command completion with drop-down menu and case sensitive/insensitive ability, semantic text menus recognizing web URLs, IP addresses, PIDs, option to collapse commands, 8 / 16 / 256 colors support, drop-down look, accurate and proper window resizing with precise text repositioning come to present Final Term as an advanced, versatile terminal application.

Along with the already-existent pack of solid and exciting features, it seems that Final Term's development is targeting new features for inclusion, as in the case of the newly-announced **multiple terminals per window** support.

Essentially, the multiple-terminals-per-window allows the user to split the Final Term's window into multiple splits, splits then having the capacity to contain numerous tabs.

As seen in the below GIF, the modern terminal application features now a clickable menu containing *New Tab, Split Horizontally* and *Split Vertically*, clicking on *Split Horizontally*, splits the window horizontally, behavior followed by *Split Vertically*, too.

Yet, hitting the *New Tab* entry, continues to add new and new tabs into a portion/split of the Final Term's main window, therefore, permitting an advanced usage of the terminal application suitable for both regular and complex demands.

A definitely interesting aspect of the mentioned feature is its drag & drop support, dragging a tab from one split and dropping it on another split, moves the tab on the other split and, thus, moves all commands and details from one side of the terminal to another preferred area of the terminal.
