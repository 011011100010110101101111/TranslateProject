Xubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) has been released along with all the other distribution, but it's not a major improvement over the previous version. Still, users should upgrade as soon as possible.

According to the changelog, a new version of xfce4-settings has been uploaded bringing amongst other things a new dialog to set up your displays, and a tool for changing your theme colors easily, gtk-theme-config, has been added to the default installation, just to mention a couple of changes.

Starting from 13.04, the Xubuntu images will not fit on standard CDs anymore. To install Xubuntu, you will need other media such as a USB device or a DVD.

More details about this release can be found in the official [announcement][1].
