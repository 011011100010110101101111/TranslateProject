If you need a super operating system to carry out your tasks, you may want to choose Ubuntu.

如果你需要一个方便的操作系统来完成自己的工作，那么最后你会选择Ubuntu。

Another thing you can do when using Ubuntu is to take screenshots of your desktop and/or active application windows. There are many third-party tools you can install to perform such tasks, but you don’t have to, because Ubuntu comes with one already installed.

你可以用Ubuntu做的另外一件事是对你的桌面截图或者激活应用程序的窗口。有很多第三方工具可以供你选择来做这些事情，但是实际你没有必要这么做，因为Ubuntu安装时就已经自带了这些功能。

This program is useful if you want to show someone how do something in Ubuntu. Screenshots are just normal image files that can stored and send via email programs to others.

To use the screenshots program, go to Dash or press the Windows key on your keyboard to bring up Dash. The Windows key is the key left of the spacebar with Windows logo.

When Dash opens, search for Screenshot, select Screenshot to open it.

Here are some of the screen you can capture:

- You can grab the whole screen
- You can grab the current program windows
- You can select a particular area and grab it

If you wan to include the mouse pointer, check the box next to it and enable it.

When you want to capture a screen, click ‘**Take Screenshot**’.  The program will disappear and automatically take a screenshot.

If you want to capture a particular area, choose that option and when you click ‘**Take Screenshot**’, the mouse pointer will change into a crosshair. You can then be drag the curser to desired size. When you stop, the image is captured automatically.

This is how you do it when you’re using Ubuntu

Hope this helps and please come back again.

Enjoy!
