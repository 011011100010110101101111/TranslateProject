Good News! You Can Now Buy the De-Googled /e/OS Smartphone from Fairphone
======

Fairphone is known for its ethical (or fair) approach of making a smartphone.

Normally, the ethical approach involves that the workers get paid well, the smartphone build materials are safer for the planet, and the phone is durable/sustainable. And, they’ve already done a good job with their [Fairphone 1][1] , [Fairphone 2][2], and [Fairphone 3][3] smartphones.

Now, to take things up a notch, Fairphone has teamed up with [/e/OS][4] which is a de-googled Android fork, to launch a separate edition of [Fairphone 3][3] (its latest smartphone) that comes with **/e/OS** out of the box.

In case you didn’t know about the mobile operating system, you can read our [interview with Gael Duval (Founder of /e/OS)][5] to know more about it.

While we already have some privacy-focused smartphones like [Librem 5][6], Fairphone 3 with /e/OS is something different to its core. In this article, I’ll try highlighting the key things that you need to know before ordering a Fairphone 3 with /e/OS loaded.

### The First Privacy Conscious &amp; Sustainable Phone

You may have noticed a privacy-focused smartphone manufactured in some corner of the world, like [Librem 5][7].

But for the most part, it looks like the Fairphone 3 is the first privacy-conscious sustainable phone to get the spotlight.

The de-googled operating system /e/OS ensures that the smartphone does not rely on Google services to function among other things. Hence, /e/OS should be a great choice for Fairphone 3 for privacy-focused users.

Also, to support /e/OS out of the box wasn’t just the decision of the manufacturer – but its community.

As per their announcement, they’ve mentioned:

> For many, fairer technology isn’t just about the device and its components, it is also about the software that powers the product; and when Fairphone community members were asked what their preferred alternative operating system (OS) was for the next Fairphone, the Fairphone 3, they voted for /e/OS.

So, it looks like the users do prefer to have /e/OS on their smartphones.

### Fairphone 3: Overview

![][9]

To tell you what I think about it, let me first share the technical specifications of the phone:

  * Dual Nano-SIM (4G LTE/3G/2G support)
  * **Display:** 5.65-inch LCD (IPS) with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection
  * **Screen Resolution**: 2160 x 1080
  * **RAM:** 4 GB
  * **Chipset**: Qualcomm Snapdragon 632
  * **Internal Storage:** 64 GB
  * **Rear Camera:** 12 MP (IMX363 sensor)
  * **Front Camera:** 8 MP
  * Bluetooth 5.0
  * WiFi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac
  * NFC Supported
  * USB-C
  * Expandable Storage supported



So, on paper, it sounds like a decent budget smartphone. But, the pricing and availability will be an important factor keeping in mind that it’s a one-of-a-kind smartphone and we don’t really have alternatives to compare to.

Not just how it’s unique for privacy-focused users, but it is potentially the easiest phone to fix (as suggested by [iFixit’s teardown][10]).

### Fairphone 3 with /e/OS: Pre-Order, Price &amp; Availability

![][11]

As for its availability – the Fairphone 3 with /e/OS is available to pre-order through the [online shop of /e/OS][12] for **€479.90** across Europe. 

If you are an existing Fairphone 3 user, you can also install /e/OS from the [available build here][13].

You get 2 years of warranty along with a 14-day return policy.

### My Thoughts On Fairphone 3 with /e/OS

It’s important to consider that the smartphone is targeting a particular group of consumers. So, it’s quite obvious that it isn’t meant for everyone. The specifications on paper may look good – but not necessarily the best bang for the buck.

Also, looking at the smartphone market right now – the specifications and its value for money matter more than what we privacy-focused users want.

But it’s definitely something impressive and I believe it’s going to get good attention specially among the privacy-aware people who don’t want their smartphone spying on them.

With Fairphone 3’s launch with /e/OS, the lesser tech savvy people can now get an out of the box privacy-focused smartphone experience.

What do you think about the Fairphone 3 with /e/OS? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.
