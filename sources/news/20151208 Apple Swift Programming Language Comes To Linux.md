================================================================================

Apple and Open Source toogether? Yes! Apple’s Swift programming language is now open source. This should not come as surprise because [Apple had already announced it six months back][1].

Apple announced the launch of open source Swift community came this week. A [new website][2] dedicated to the open source Swift community has been put in place with the following message:

> We are excited by this new chapter in the story of Swift. After Apple unveiled the Swift programming language, it quickly became one of the fastest growing languages in history. Swift makes it easy to write software that is incredibly fast and safe by design. Now that Swift is open source, you can help make the best general purpose programming language available everywhere.

[swift.org][2] will work as the one stop shop providing downloads for various platforms, community guidelines, news, getting started tutorials, instructions for contribution to open source Swift, documentation and other guidelines. If you are looking forward to learn Swift, this website must be bookmarked.

In this announcement, a new package manager for easy sharing and building code has been made available as well.

Most important of all for Linux users, the source code is now available at [Github][3]. You can check it out from the link below:

- [Apple Swift Source Code][3]

In addition to that, there are prebuilt binaries for Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.10.

- [Swift binaries for Ubuntu][4]

Don’t rush to use them because these are development branches and will not be suitable for production machine. So avoid it for now. Once stable version of Swift for Linux is released, I hope that Ubuntu will include it in [umake][5] on the line of [Visual Studio][6].
