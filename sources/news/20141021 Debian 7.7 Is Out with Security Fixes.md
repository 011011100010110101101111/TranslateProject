Debian gets regular major updates for the distribution, but if you already have it installed and you keep it up to date you won't need to do anything extra. The developers have implemented a few important fixes, so it's recommended to upgrade as soon as possible.

"This update mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable release, along with a few adjustments for serious problems. Security advisories were already published separately and are referenced where available."

"Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of Debian 7 but only updates some of the packages included. There is no need to throw away old wheezy CDs or DVDs but only to update via an up-to-date Debian mirror after an installation, to cause any out of date packages to be updated," noted the developers in the official [announcement][1].

The devs have upgrade the Bash package, the closed some important exploits, the SSH login at boot no longer works, and a few other tweaks have been made.

Check out the complete changelog in the official announcement for more details about the release.
