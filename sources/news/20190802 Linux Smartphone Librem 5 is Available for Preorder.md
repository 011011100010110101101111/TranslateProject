Here’s what Purism mentioned about Librem 5 in its blog post:

_**We believe phones should not track you nor exploit your digital life.**_

_The Librem 5 represents the opportunity for you to take back control and protect your private information, your digital life through free and open source software, open governance, and transparency. The Librem 5 is_ **_a phone built on_ [_PureOS_][3]**_, a fully free, ethical and open-source operating system that is_ _**not based on Android or iOS**_ _(learn more about [why this is important][7])._

_We have successfully crossed our crowdfunding goals and will be delivering on our promise. The Librem 5’s hardware and software development is advancing [at a steady pace][8], and is scheduled for an initial release in Q3 2019. You can preorder the phone at $649 until shipping begins and regular pricing comes into effect. Kits with an external monitor, keyboard and mouse, are also available for preorder._

### Librem 5 Specifications

From what it looks like, Librem 5 definitely aims to provide better privacy and security. In addition to this, it tries to avoid using anything from Google or Apple.

While the idea is good enough – how does it hold up as a commercial smartphone under $700?

Let us take a look at the tech specs:

On paper the tech specs seems to be good enough. Not too great – not too bad. But, what about the performance? The user experience?

Well, we can’t be too sure about it – unless we use it. So, if you are pre-ordering it – take that into consideration.

### Lifetime software updates for Librem 5

Of course, the specs aren’t very pretty when compared to the smartphones available at this price range.

However, with the promise of lifetime software updates – it does look like a decent offering for open source enthusiasts.

### Other Key Features

Purism also highlights the fact that Librem 5 will be the first-ever [Matrix][12]-powered smartphone. This means that it will support end-to-end decentralized encrypted communications for messaging and calling.

In addition to all these, the presence of headphone jack and a user-replaceable battery makes it a pretty solid deal.

### Wrapping Up

Even though it is tough to compete with the likes of Android/iOS smartphones, having an alternative is always good. Librem 5 may not prove to be an ideal smartphone for every user – but if you are an open-source enthusiast and looking for a simple smartphone that respects privacy and security without utilizing Google/Apple services, this is for you.

Also the fact that it will receive lifetime software updates – makes it an interesting smartphone.
