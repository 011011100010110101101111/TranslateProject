**Git 2.0.2, a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency, has been officially released.**

The new Git 2.0.x branch continues the trend of large releases, integrating a big number of changes and fixes. This latest update may be just a maintenance one, but it does feature some interesting modifications.

According to the developers, the documentation for the "git submodule sync" mentions that the subcommand can take the "--recursive" option, the mishandling of patterns in .gitignore that had trailing SPs quoted with backslashes has been corrected, and the Recent updates to "git repack" no longer duplicate objects that are in the packfiles marked with .keep flag by mistake.

Also, "git clone -b brefs/tags/bar" no longer thinks that git follows a single tag, even though it was a name of the branch, "%G" (nothing after G) is an invalid pretty format specifier and now the parser knows that it's garbage, the code used to avoid adding the same alternate object store twice has been fixed, and a couple of other fixes have been implemented.

For a complete list of changes, check out the [changelog][1].
