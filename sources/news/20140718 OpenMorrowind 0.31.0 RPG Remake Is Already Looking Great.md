**OpenMW, an open source implementation of The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind game engine and functionality, is now at version 0.31.0 and packs lots of new features.**

OpenMW, or OpenMorrowind, is a project that aims to bring one of best role-playing games ever created into the open source world, but not by simple porting. The makers of this title have been working non-stop in the last months and it seems that the game is really starting to take shape.

Half a year ago, players couldn't do much in OpenMW, but now a lot of features have been integrated, and it's almost playable if you don't expect too much. Even with all the changes in place, the version number indicates that the development is moving rather slowly and numerous problems still remain. It will take a long time until the game reaches a stable version, but when it gets there, it's going to be an awesome RPG.

“The OpenMW team is proud to announce the release of version 0.31.0! This release includes implementation of many smaller features that have been sorely missing, as well fixes for a ridiculous amount of bugs. Many thanks to our developers for their relentless attention to detail. Some optimization has made it into this release, let us know if you see any increased performance,” reads the announcement on the official website.

A number of important changes have been made and lots of new stuff has been added. For example, a periodic cleanup/refill has been added, precipitation and weather particles are now ready in the engine, the dialog has been merged, saving missing creature state is now working properly, the murder crime has been implemented, a number of sneak skill enhancements have been added, and animated main menu support has been implemented.

Also, the clouds and weather have been modified to better match vanilla Morrowind, the background tracks are no longer repeating, the dead body collision behavior has been improved, and lots of other fixes have been implemented.

A complete list of changes and new features can be found in the official [announcement][1]. Users must legally own and install the game before they can use OpenMW – as it is intended – to play Morrowind.
