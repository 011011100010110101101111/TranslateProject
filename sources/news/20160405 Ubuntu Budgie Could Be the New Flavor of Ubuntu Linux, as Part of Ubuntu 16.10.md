Ubuntu Budgie Could Be the New Flavor of Ubuntu Linux, as Part of Ubuntu 16.10
===

> The Beta 2 of Budgie-Remix is now ready for testing.

Last month we told you about a new GNU/Linux distribution called [Budgie-Remix][1], whose ultimate goal is to become an official Ubuntu Linux flavor, possibly under the name of Ubuntu Budgie.

Today, Budgie-Remix developer David Mohammed informs Softpedia about the progress made with the project, which Canonical founder [Mark Shuttleworth said][2] that it would definitely support if there were a community around the packaging, as well as the availability of the second Beta build for the upcoming 16.04 release.

Since our [initial report][3], it looks like David Mohammed managed to get in contact with the Ubuntu MATE project leader Martin Wimpress, who urged him to target Ubuntu 16.10 for an official status of his soon-to-be-named Ubuntu flavor built on top of the Budgie desktop environment created by the amazing team of developers from [Solus][4].

"We've hit Beta 2 this week with lots of goodies and also we have the support of Martin Wimpress (Ubuntu MATE project leader)," said David Mohammed exclusively for Softpedia. "He has urged us to target 16.10 for official status - that is certainly a major challenge - and we need the community to help out/join us to make this happen!"

### Ubuntu Budgie 16.10 might see the light of day in October 2016 ###

On April 21, Canonical will release the next LTS (Long Term Support) release of Ubuntu Linux, the Xenial Xerus a.k.a. Ubuntu 16.04, and we might be able to get an early taste of what could become the official Ubuntu Budgie flavor, as Budgie-Remix 16.04. But until then, you can help the developer [test drive the Beta 2 release][5].

Immediately after the release of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus), the Ubuntu developers will concentrate all of their efforts on the next version, Ubuntu 16.10, which should arrive later this year, sometimes at the end of October, and Ubuntu Budgie 16.10 might also be announced as an official Ubuntu flavor.
