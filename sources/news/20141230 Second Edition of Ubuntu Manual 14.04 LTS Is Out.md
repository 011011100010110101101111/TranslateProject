============================================================
Beginners will find good info in this manual
------------------------------------------------------------
### The Ubuntu Manual Team announces that the second edition of the famous manual has been released and is now available for free download. ###

The Ubuntu Manual usually covers the LTS releases made by Canonical, so it only stands to reason that the current version is now focused on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) release made six months ago. Like any other book out there, especially in large ones, mistakes occur or maybe it was left out. In any case, this is a digital edition so it's quite easy to fix and improve.

You might think it's weird to have a manual for an operating system that is free and easy to try by anyone. Sometimes just having a big community is not enough. There are always new users who don't know the basic things about this operating system, so having a manual at hand that can point even to the simplest things is always an advantage.

### This is the second edition for "Getting Started with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS" manual ###

Users who just adopted Ubuntu will find that that it's rather different from other platforms they used before, like Windows or Mac OS X. That's perfectly normal and you might not always have the resources or the knowledge to search for a particular feature or functionality online. Having a manual that describes the basics of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS can really make a difference.

"Getting Started with Ubuntu 14.04e2 is a comprehensive beginners guide for the Ubuntu operating system. It is written under an open source license and is free for you to download, read, modify and share. The manual will help you become familiar with everyday tasks such as surfing the web, listening to music and scanning documents. With an emphasis on easy to follow instructions, it is suitable for all levels of experience."

"The manual is a quick-start guide that will get you doing the things you need to do with your computer easily, without getting bogged down with technical details. With the help of this guide, it should not take long before new users get used to the Unity desktop environment," reads the official [website][1].

This is the second edition of the manual and the team that worked on it has a great deal of experience. Even if you are an Ubuntu user, it doesn't hurt browsing through it because you might get to learn something. You can [download the Ubuntu Manual 14.04 2nd Edition][2] from Softpedia.
