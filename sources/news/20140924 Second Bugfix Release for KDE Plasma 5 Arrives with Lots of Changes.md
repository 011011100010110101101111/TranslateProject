KDE Plasma 5

### The KDE Community has announced that the second bugfix release for Plasma 5 is now out and available for download. ###

Bugfix releases for the KDE Plasma 5, the new desktop experience that will be an integral part of the KDE ecosystem, have started to arrive very often.

"This release, versioned plasma-5.0.2, adds a month's worth of new translations and fixes from KDE's contributors. The bugfixes are typically small but important such as fixing text which couldn't be translated, using the correct icons and fixing overlapping files with KDELibs 4 software. It also adds a month's hard work of translations to make support in other languages even more complete," reads the [announcement][1].

This particular desktop is not yet implemented by default in any Linux distro and it will be a while until we are able to test it properly.

The developers also explain that the updated packages can be reviewed in the development versions of Kubuntu Plasma 5.

You can also download the source packages, if you need them individually.

You also have to keep in mind that KDE Plasma 5.0.2 is a sophisticated piece of software and you really need to know what you are doing if you decide to compile it.
