Free and Open Source Trello Alternative OpenProject 9 Released
======

[OpenProject][1] is a collaborative open source project management software. It’s an alternative to proprietary solutions like [Trello][2] and [Jira][3].

You can use it for free if it’s for personal use and you set it up (and host it) on your own server. This way, you control your data.

Of course, you get access to premium features and priority help if you are a [Cloud or Enterprise edition user][4].

The OpenProject 9 release emphasizes on new board views, package list view, and work templates.

If you didn’t know about this, you can give it a try. But, if you are an existing user – you should know what’s new before migrating to OpenProject 9.

### What’s New in OpenProject 9?

Here are some of the major changes in the latest release of OpenProject.

#### Scrum & Agile Boards

For Cloud and Enterprise editions, there’s a new [scrum][6] and [agile][7] board view. You also get to showcase your work in a [kanban-style][8] fashion, making it easier to support your agile and scrum teams.

The new board view makes it easy to know who’s assigned for the task and update the status in a jiffy. You also get different board view options like basic board, status board, and version boards.

#### Work Package templates

![Work Package Template][9]

You don’t have to create everything from scratch for every unique work package. So, instead, you just keep a template – so that you can use it whenever you need to create a new work package. It will save a lot of time.

#### New Work Package list view

![Work Package View][10]

In the work package list, there’s a subtle new addition that lets you view the avatars of the assigned people for a specific work.

#### Customizable work package view for my page

Your own page to display what you are working on (and the progress) shouldn’t be always boring. So, now you get the ability to customize it and even add a Gantt chart to visualize your work.
