Readers' Choice Awards 2014--Linux Journal
================================================================================
It's time for another Readers' Choice issue of Linux Journal! The format last year was well received, so we've followed suit making your voices heard loud again. I couldn't help but add some commentary in a few places, but for the most part, we just reported results. Please enjoy this year's Readers' Choice Awards!

We'd like to make Readers' Choice Awards even better next year. Please send ideas for new categories and any comments or feedback via [http://www.linuxjournal.com/contact][1].

Please see the December 2014 issue of Linux Journal for the complete list of winners.

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/11781f1.jpg)

Although this year the Debian/Ubuntu-based distros took the lion's share of the votes, the "Best Linux Distribution" category is a bit like "Best Kind of Pizza"—even the bottom of the list is still pizza.

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/11781f2.jpg)

Android is such a dominant force in the mobile world, we decided to allow Android variants to be counted separately. So although the underlying system on some of these are indeed Android, it seems far more informative this way.

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/11781f5.jpg)

We are a Raspberry Pi-loving bunch, that's for sure! But really, who can blame us? With the new B+ model, the already awesome RPi is getting sleeker and more useful. I'm no fortune teller, but I suspect I know next year's winner already.

### Best Laptop Vendor ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/lenovo.jpg)

This category used to be a rating of which vendors worked the best with Linux, but thankfully, now most laptops work fairly well. So, we truly get to see the cream rise to the top and focus on things other than "it works with Linux". It's awesome living in the future. 

- Lenovo 32%
- ASUS 19.3%
- Dell 18.5%
- System76 10.6%
- Other 7.9%*
- Acer 4.5%
- ThinkPenguin 1.9%

### Best Linux-Friendly Web Hosting Company ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/question.jpg)

When it comes to Web hosting, it's hard to find a company that isn't Linux-friendly these days. In fact, finding a hosting provider running Windows is more of a challenge. As is obvious by our winner ("Other"), the options are amazing. Perhaps a "Worst Web Hosting" category would be more useful! 

- Other 22.8%*
- Amazon 22.5%
- Rackspace 13.1%
- Linode 10.4%
- GoDaddy.com 6.5%
- OVH 5.6%

*Under "Other", the most write-ins went to (in this order) Digital Ocean (by a landslide), followed by Hetzner, BlueHost and WebFaction. 

### Best Web Browser ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/11781f7.jpg)

Firefox takes the gold this year by a significant margin. Even if you combine Chrome and Chromium, Firefox still takes the top spot. There was a time when we worried that the faithful Firefox would fade away, but thankfully, it's remained strong and continues to be a fast, viable, compatible browser. 

- Firefox 53.8%
- Chrome 26.9%
- Chromium 8.1%
- Iceweasel 4%
- Opera 3%
- Other 2%
- SeaMonkey .8%
- rekonq .5%
- dwb .4%
- QupZill .4%
- Dillo .2% 

### Best E-mail Client ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/11781f8.jpg)

If I didn't know firsthand how many hard-core geeks live among us, I might accuse Kyle Rankin of voting fraud. His beloved Mutt e-mail client doesn't take top spot, but for a program without any graphical interface, third place is impressive! 

- Mozilla Thunderbird 44.4%
- Gmail 24.7%
- Mutt 6.8%
- Evolution 5.5%
- KMail 5.3%
- Other 3.2%
- Claws Mail 2.2%

- SeaMonkey 1%
- Opera Mail .9%
- Sylpheed .4% 

### Best Audio Editing Tool ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/11781f9.jpg)

- VLC 9.7%
- Ardour 4.9%
- Other 1.9%
- SoX 1.3%
- Mixxx 1.1%
- LMMS .7%
- Format Junkie .5% 

### Best Audio Player ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/11781f10.jpg)

We figured VLC would take top spot in the video player category (see below), but it was a bit of a surprise to see how many folks prefer it as an audio player as well. Perhaps it's become the one-stop shop for media playback. Either way, we're thrilled to see VLC on the top. 

- VLC 25.2%
- Amarok 15.3%
- Rhythmbox 10.4%
- Clementine 8.6%
- MPlayer 6.1%
- Spotify 5.9%
- Audacious 5.5%

- Amarok 1.4%
- Xmms .3%
- Daum Potplayer .2%
- Clementine .1% 

*Under "Other", most write-ins were for SMPlayer. 

### Best Video Editor ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/11781f10_1.jpg)

This is another testament to the geek factor when it comes to our readers. We didn't specify "non-linear editor", so by a transcoding technicality, VLC eked out a win in the video editing category. Well played, VLC, well played. 

- VLC 17.5%
- Kdenlive 16.4%
- Blender 15.1%
- Avidemux 13.2%
- OpenShot 13.2%
- Cinelerra 7.5%

- LightWorks 4.8%
- Other 4.7%
- LiVES 1.4%
- Shotcut .6%
- Jahshaka .4%
- Flowblade .4% 

### Best Cloud-Based File Storage ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/11781f11.jpg)

In a category that used to have few options, Dropbox still takes top spot, but the margin is closing. It's hard to argue against Dropbox's convenience and stability, but hosting your own data on ownCloud gives it quite a boost into the second-place spot. 

- Dropbox 30.5%
- ownCloud 23.6%
- Google Drive 16%
- rsync 8.3%
- Other 7.5%*
- Amazon S3 6.6%
- SpiderOak 4.4%
- Box 1.8%
- Copy 1%
- AjaXplorer .3%

*Under "Other", the most write-ins went to Younited and MEGA. Many also said things like "no cloud is the best choice/my files stay on my storage/local only". 

### Best Linux Game ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/CIVILIZATION-V-FRONT-OF-BOX.jpg)

I rarely play games, so every year I look forward to this category to find the most popular options for those few times I do. I'm personally tickled to see NetHack so high on the list, especially considering the opposition. There's just something about wandering around random tunnels that appeals to the old-school DnD player in all of us. 

- Civilization 5 26.5%
- Other 23.5%*
- Team Fortress 2 8.7%
- NetHack 8.4%
- X-Plane 10 7.1%
- Dota 6.1%
- Bastion 5.4%
- Scorched 3D 3.7%
- Destiny 3.6%
- Ultima IV 1.9%
- FreeCol 1.8%
- Kpat 1.4%
- FreeOrion 1.1%
- Ryzom .9% 

*Under "Other", the most write-ins were (in this order) Minecraft, 0 A.D., Frozen Bubble, Battle for Wesnoth, Portal and Counter Strike. 

### Best Virtualization Solution ###

I think the relationship with Vagrant has helped Oracle's VirtualBox significantly in popularity. Yes, Vagrant works with other virtualization platforms, but since it so seamlessly integrates with VirtualBox, I think it gets quite a boost. Virtualization is such an efficient and reliable way to implement systems, bare-metal solutions are almost a thing of the past! 

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/Virtualbox_logo_0.jpg)

- Oracle VM VirtualBox 33.4%
- VMware 22.3%
- KVM 21.1%
- XEN 5.7%
- QEMU 5.3%
- OpenStack 4.9%
- Other 4.2%*
- OpenVZ 1.7%
- Linux-VServer 1.3%
- Symantec Workspace Virtualization .1% 

*Under "Other", the most write-ins went to Docker, ProxMox and LXC, in that order. 

### Best Monitoring Application ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/Nagios-Core-4.0.8.png)

- Nagios 27.1%
- Wireshark 20.7%
- htop 12.3%
- Zabbix 10.5%
- Other 8.6%*
- Zenoss 6.2%
- Munin 3.4%
- PC Monitor 2.8%
- New Relic 1.9%
- Opsview 1.2%
- SaltStack 1%
- NTM (Network Traffic Monitor) .7%
- xosview .7%
- Manage Engine .5%
- FlowViewer .3%
- Circonus .2%
- SysPeek .2% 

*Under "Other", most write-ins went to Icinga and OpenNMS. 

### Best DevOps Configuration Management Tool ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/Git-Logo-2Color.jpg)

It was interesting to see Git take top spot in this category, because although it certainly would work to use standard version control on configuration files, I always assumed it would be used alongside tools like Chef or Puppet. If nothing else, the DevOps movement has taught crusty old system administrators like myself to treat configuration files like code. Version control is incredible, and it seems as though most readers agree. 

- Git 39.4%
- Puppet 17.2%
- Ansible 8.9%
- cron jobs 8.8%
- Subversion 7.6%
- Chef 5%
- SaltStack 5.4%
- Other 4.6%*
- CFEngine 3% 

*Under "Other", most write-ins went to NixOps. 

### Best Programming Language ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/11781f13.jpg)

- Python 30.2%
- C++ 17.8%
- C 16.7%
- Perl 7.1%
- Java 6.9%
- Other 4.6%
- Ruby 4.3%
- Go 2.4%
- JavaScript 2.4%
- QML 2.2%
- Fortran 1.4%
- Haskell 1.4%
- Lisp 1.2%
- Erlang .6%
- Rust .6%
- D .4%
- Hack .1% 

*Under "Other", most write-ins went to Scala, PHP and Clojure (in that order). 

### Best Scripting Language ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/11781f13_0.jpg)

Python is incredibly powerful, and it appears to be a favorite in both the scripting and programming categories. As someone who knows Bash and a little PHP, I think it's clear what I need to focus on as I delve into the world of development. Meaningful whitespace, here I come! 

- Python 37.1%
- Bash/Shell scripts 27%
- Perl 11.8%
- PHP 8.4%
- JavaScript 6.7%
- Ruby 4.9%
- Other 2.1%
- Lua 2% 

### Best New Linux/Open-Source Product/Project ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/11781f14.jpg)

Docker is clearly our winner here, and rightly so—what a game-changing technology. It's nice to see Jolla/Sailfish get some love as well. We love Android, but having a choice is a vital part of who we are as Open Source advocates. 

- Docker 28%
- Jolla and Sailfish OS 19%
- LibreOffice 7%
- ownCloud 5%
- Steam 5%
- Zenoss Control Center 5%
- Raspberry Pi 4%
- Git 4%
- Apache Cordova/OpenOffice/Spark/Tika 3%
- Ansible 2%
- Elementary OS 2%
- OpenStack 2%
- Zabbix 2%
- CoreOS 2%
- Firefox OS 2%
- KDE Connect 1%
- NixOS and NixOps 1%
- Open Media Vault 1% 

### Coolest Thing You've Ever Done with Linux ###

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/slideshow-400/tux_cruise.png)

This is my favorite new category for the Readers' Choice Awards. Imagine attending a Linux conference and asking everyone the coolest thing they've done with Linux. That's basically what happened here! We've listed a handful of our favorites, but for the entire list, check out: [http://www.linuxjournal.com/rc2014/coolest][2]. 

Note: the most common answers were "use it"; "rescue data/photos/whatever off broken Windows machines"; "convert friends/family/businesses to Linux"; "learn"; "teach"; "get a job"; "home automation"; and "build a home media server". The following list is of our favorite more-specific and unique answers, not the most common ones.
