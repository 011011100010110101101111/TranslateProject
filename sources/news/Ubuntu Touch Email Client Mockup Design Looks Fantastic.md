Ubuntu Touch Email Client Mockup Design Looks Fantastic
================================================================================
One of the most anticipated applications for Ubuntu Touch is by far the email app, and heavy battles are being fought on that front. Now, a designer proposed a look for the new app and shared a mockup on Google+.

All the users of Ubuntu Touch are waiting for the email client that will inevitably arrive sometime in the near future, but now it's also easier to picture it because [Andrea Del Sarto][1] published a mockup that looks fabulous.

Users have limited experience when it comes to email clients, and everything we know about how an email app should look and work is taken from Blackberry, Android, or iOS. The Ubuntu developers have a difficult road ahead of them because they are starting from scratch and they must somehow make the Ubuntu experience feel different from what everyone else is making.

The mockup is a good start and, to be fair, this actually looks a lot better than anything that has already been accomplished on other platforms. The work for the design is just starting, but from what we have seen so far the Ubuntu email client will look great and it will fully use the best feature of Ubuntu Touch, the bottom edge.
