Oracle today marked a major milestone in the company’s autonomous strategy with the introduction of Oracle Autonomous Linux – the world’s first autonomous operating system.

Oracle Autonomous Linux, along with the new Oracle OS Management Service, is the first and only autonomous operating environment that eliminates complexity and human error to deliver unprecedented cost savings, security and availability for customers, the company claims in a just released statement.

Keeping systems patched and secure is one of the biggest ongoing challenges faced by IT today. With Oracle Autonomous Linux, the company says, customers can rely on autonomous capabilities to help ensure their systems are secure and highly available to help prevent cyberattacks.

“Oracle Autonomous Linux builds on Oracle’s proven history of delivering Linux with extreme performance, reliability and security to run the most demanding enterprise applications,” said Wim Coekaerts, senior vice president of operating systems and virtualization engineering, Oracle.

“Today we are taking the next step in our autonomous strategy with Oracle Autonomous Linux, providing a rich set of capabilities to help our customers significantly improve reliability and protect their systems from cyberthreats,” he added.

**Oracle OS Management Service**

Along with Oracle Autonomous Linux, Oracle introduced Oracle OS Management Service, a highly available Oracle Cloud Infrastructure component that delivers control and visibility over systems whether they run Autonomous Linux, Linux or Windows.

Combined with resource governance policies, OS Management Service, via the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console or APIs, also enables users to automate capabilities that will execute common management tasks for Linux systems, including patch and package management, security and compliance reporting, and configuration management.

It can be further automated with other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services like auto-scaling as workloads need to grow or shrink to meet elastic demand.

**Always Free Autonomous Database and Cloud Infrastructure**

Oracle Autonomous Linux, in conjunction with Oracle OS Management Service, uses advanced machine learning and autonomous capabilities to deliver unprecedented cost savings, security and availability and frees up critical IT resources to tackle more strategic initiatives.

They are included with Oracle Premier Support at no extra charge with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure compute services. Combined with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s other cost advantages, most Linux workload customers can expect to have 30-50 percent TCO savings versus both on-premise and other cloud vendors over five years.

“Adding autonomous capabilities to the operating system layer, with future plans to expand beyond infrastructure software, goes straight after the OpEx challenges nearly all customers face today,” said Al Gillen, Group VP, Software Development and Open Source, IDC.

“This capability effectively turns Oracle Linux into a service, freeing customers to focus their IT resources on application and user experience, where they can deliver true competitive differentiation,” he added.
