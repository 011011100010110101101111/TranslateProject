Fail-free Kubernetes, significant events, and more industry trends
======
A weekly look at open source community, market, and industry trends.
![Person standing in front of a giant computer screen with numbers, data][1]

As part of my role as a senior product marketing manager at an enterprise software company with an open source development model, I publish a regular update about open source community, market, and industry trends for product marketers, managers, and other influencers. Here are five of my and their favorite articles from that update.

## [Why teams fail with Kubernetes—and what to do about it][2]

> Fail to address the questions "Who is responsible for _x_?" and "Who is affected by _y_?" and you'll put all your efforts at risk. For example, replace "_x_" above with "deciding on namespaces versus clusters for service and environment isolation" or "upgrading all clusters to a new Kubernetes version," and you start to see why you need to clarify the boundaries of responsibility and their impacts.

**The impact**: Wouldn't it be nice if operators and role-based access control could make the messiness of human interaction go away? Why can't auto-scaling just mean auto-scaling? Tough luck! You're going to have to figure out the people side of it too!

## [The New Stack Context: The past, present, and future of Kubernetes][3]

> What have been some of the most significant events in the Kubernetes and cloud native community over the past year? A lot of work has been done in slimming and stabilizing the core. Operators were a growing trend over the past year—operators are mechanisms to expand the number of things you can build on top of Kubernetes. We are seeing Kubernetes expand into new workloads as well.

**The impact**: In some way, Kubernetes is an ongoing effort in re-building the airplane mid-flight. The good news is that we're getting better at doing that, and the future holds ubiquity, according to this podcast.

## [Q&amp;A: Fidelity invests in cloud-native, open source projects to step up innovation][4]

> “We are seeing that Kubernetes, CNCF, and cloud-native technology are the key players for us when we go multicloud and hybrid-cloud model,” said [Amr Abdelhalem][5] (pictured), head of cloud platforms at Fidelity Investments. “That’s why we are here. We are here actually in Kubernetes and KubeCon for that reason. That’s where we see this abstract layer that guarantees you the portability for moving your application from one cloud provider to another.”

**The impact**: Think about this: Fidelity is a member of the CNCF. What does that mean about the distance between the creator and consumer of open source software? It's exciting because it exemplifies the participatory ideals of open source; its a new challenge for the ecosystem because participants are starting to represent industry verticals that might not have much overlap whose needs need reconciliation. Fun times!

## [The future of hybrid cloud is bright as 73% of enterprises moving apps back on Prem][6]

> This year’s report illustrated that creating and executing a cloud strategy has become a multidimensional challenge. At one time, a primary value proposition associated with the public cloud was substantial upfront capex savings. Now, enterprises have discovered that there are other considerations when selecting the best cloud for the business as well, and that one size cloud strategy doesn’t fit all use cases. For example, while applications with unpredictable usage may be best suited to the public clouds offering elastic IT resources, workloads with more predictable characteristics can often run on-premises at a lower cost than public cloud. Savings are also dependent on businesses’ ability to match each application to the appropriate cloud service and pricing tier, and to remain diligent about regularly reviewing service plans and fees, which change frequently.

**The impact**: The short version is that cost is not the only, or even the most important factor, in choosing where to run a workload. More and more often it is the nature of the workload itself.

_I hope you enjoyed this list of what stood out to me from last week and come back next Monday for more open source community, market, and industry trends._
