Tiny Core desktop

**Robert Shingledecker has announced the immediate availability for download of the final version of the Tiny Core 5.4 Linux operating system, which also happens to be one the smaller operating systems in the world.**

The name of the distro says pretty much everything about the operating system, but the developers have integrated some interesting packages and a very light desktop to match it. This latest iteration only had a single Release Candidate and it's one of the quietest releases made so far. 

"Tiny Core is simply an example of what the Core Project can produce, an 12MB FLTK/FLWM desktop. The user has complete control over which applications and/or additional hardware to have supported, be it for a desktop, a netbook, an appliance, or server, selectable by the user by installing additional applications from online repositories, or easily compiling most anything you desire using tools provided," says the dev on the official website.

According to the changelog, entries for nfs server have been added, 'Done' is now printed in a new lin, and udev has been updated to version 174 to fix a race condition.

A complete list of updates and changes can be found in the official [announcement][1].

You can download Tiny Core Linux 5.4.
