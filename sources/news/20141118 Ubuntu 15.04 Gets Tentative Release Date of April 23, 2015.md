**Doing anything special on April 23 next year? You might well be — it’s the tentative release date being given for Ubuntu 15.04 ‘Vivid Vervet’.**

The date, along with those of various other development milestones, is listed as part of a [draft release schedule][1] on the Ubuntu Wiki page for the ‘V’ update. As of writing all dates are subject to approval from the Ubuntu release team and are therefore **not final**. 

Ubuntu’s previous spring release, 14.04 LTS, went live on April 17, 2014.

### Veracity Potential is Void ###

Dates not yet ready to be inked in

Draft means just that, but having covered some 10 Ubuntu release over five years I do know that the proposed dates don’t tend to differ too wildly from those that go final (famous last words, I’m sure!).

Even so, take the proposals with a pinch of optimism for now. I’ll be keeping both this page and the fancy-schmancy graphic updated as, if or when anything changes.

### Key Ubuntu 15.04 Release Dates ###

As with all releases post-13.04, Ubuntu proper only makes fleeting appearances in select milestone releases, specifically the ‘final beta’ and the ‘release candidate’ stages.

Ubuntu’s family of flavours, which may include Ubuntu MATE this cycle, take full advantage of the testing opportunities at hand.

- **Alpha 1** – December 18th (for flavours)
- **Alpha 2** – January 22nd (for flavours)
- *Feature Freeze* — February 19th
- **Beta 1** – August 28th (for flavours)
- *UI Freeze* — March 12th
- **Final Beta** – March 26th
- *Kernel Freeze* — April 9th
- **Release Candidate** – April 16th

The final release of the Vivid Vervet in all its vivacious glory is pencilled in for release on:

- **Ubuntu 15.04 Final** – April 23rd
