Linux Lite 5.0 Released With UEFI Support & Other Major Improvements
======

Linux Lite is one of the [best Linux distributions suitable for Windows users][1]. Not just limited to that, it’s also one of the most preferred [lightweight Linux distributions][2] available.

Linux Lite 4.x series based on Ubuntu 18.04 was good but it didn’t have [UEFI support][3]. But, now that Linux Lite 5.0 has finally arrived based on [Ubuntu 20.04][4] and I’m excited to see the changes!

In this article, we’ll take a look at what’s new in Linux Lite 5.0.

### Linux Lite 5.0: Key Changes

![][5]

With Linux Lite 5.0, they have finally added the support for [UEFI][3] along with numerous significant improvements. Let’s take a brief look at what has changed:

#### UEFI Support

Linux Lite 5.0 supports UEFI out-of-the-box. However, they recommend disabling the [Secure Boot][6] feature even though it should work with that.

You can take a look at one of their [forum threads][8] to understand more about it. Not to mention, you can also find more information about it in the new inbuilt **Help Manual**.

#### Ubuntu-based distro with no hidden telemetry

If you were looking for a Linux distribution that’s based on Ubuntu but without any hidden telemetry, Linux Lite 5.0 seemts to be the perfect option.

In the [release announcement][9], they mentioned it in the changelog along with a screenshot that you can see here:

#### GUFW Firewall replaced by firewallId

You might have read about [setting up a firewall using GUFW on Linux][11] but starting with Linux Lite 5.0, it has been replaced by [firewallId][12].

It seems that [GUFW][14] isn’t as configurable as firewallId. Hence, they decided to replace it.

By default, it is disabled. But, you can choose to enable it by following one of the tutorials in the **Help Manual**.

#### Latest Whisker Menu

![][15]

[Whisker Menu][16] has been updated to the latest package (v2.4.4) available. In addition to the update, you can also notice that “**Install Updates**” is now pinned to the favorites section.

#### HiDPI Settings

![][17]

You will find it very easy to utilize the HiDPI settings from the **Settings menu** if you need it.

#### XFCE Screensaver Added

With Linux Lite 5.0, you will also notice the addition of [XFCE screensaver][18] program — which is disabled by default.

![][19]

It’s a simple addition that should be useful for users who always wanted a screensaver app and the ability to tweak it.

### Other Important Improvements

In addition to the key highlights mentioned above, there are several other changes that should come in handy for Linux Lite 5.0 users. I’ve listed some of them here:

  * [Mousepad][20] replaces [Leafpad][21]
  * New update notification
  * Integrity Check during live boot
  * Major improvements to the **Help Manual**
  * Added Chromium as a Snap package
  * New Logout options
  * Lite Welcome screen and Lite User Manager now updated to GTK3 and Python3.
  * New options added to the Welcome screen: **Select Dark or Light Theme, UEFI &amp; Secure Boot, Feedback**
  * Improved Lite Widget



You can find a list of detailed changes in their [official announcement post][9] if you want to explore more about it.

### Wrapping Up

I think Linux Lite 5.0 is better than ever and with all the recent additions it’s also going to be a fantastic option for a lot of new Linux users.
