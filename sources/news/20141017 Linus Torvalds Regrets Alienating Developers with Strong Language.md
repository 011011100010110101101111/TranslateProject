Linus Torvalds对于骂那些开发者感到后悔
================================================================================
> 他没有提到任何人的名字，但是这像一次道歉

**Linus Torvalds在前几天的欧洲LinuxCon和CloudOpen大会上做了讲话，这次大会由Linux基金会组织并且汇聚了开源世界的所有大佬。他回答了很多问题，也谈到了他在邮件发送清单里使用脏话的事情。**

Linus Torvalds被认为是Linux内核的创造者和最新的Linux开发版的维护者。他确保我们几乎每个星期都会得到一个新的RC内核并且涉及发生在邮件发送清单中的对话里，他口不择言地用脏话大骂一些开发者们。

The latest problem of this kind, which surfaced in the news as well, was when [he decided to block code from a particular developer][1], after making some very harsh remarks. He is known to be very abrasive, especially when kernel developers break user space to fix something in the kernel. The same happened in this case and he basically went mental on the guy.

### 这是他最接近道歉的一次谈话 ###

Linus Torvalds never really talked about that particular discussion since and people moved on, but recently a systemd developer talked about the strong language in the open source community and he mentioned Linus Torvalds by name. He's not known to apologize, so this admission of guilt during LinuxCon is a big step forward. The moderator asked him what single decision in the last 23 years he would change.

"From a technical standpoint, no single decision has ever been that important... The problems tend to be around alienating users or developers and I'm pretty good at that. I use strong language. But again there's not a single instance I'd like to fix. There's a metric [expletive]load of those."

"One of the reasons we have this culture of strong language, that admittedly many people find off-putting, is that when it comes to technical people with strong opinions and with a strong drive to do something technically superior, you end up having these opinions show up as sometimes pretty strong language," [said][2] Linus Torvalds.

He didn't mention anyone by name or any specific incident, but the proximity to the complaints issued by Leonart Pottering, the systemd developer, seems to point towards that issue.

It also looks like Linux kernel 3.18 RC1 will arrive later this week and we'll soon have something new to play with.
