Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

**Canonical has published details in a security notice about an nginx vulnerability that affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr). The problem has been identified and fixed.**

The Ubuntu developers have fixed a small nginx exploit. They explain that nginx could have been made to expose sensitive information over the network.

According to the security notice, “Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that nginx incorrectly reused cached SSL sessions. An attacker could possibly use this issue in certain configurations to obtain access to information from a different virtual host.”

For a more detailed description of the problems, you can see Canonical's security [notification][1]. Users should upgrade their Linux distribution in order to correct this issue.

The problem can be repaired by upgrading the system to the latest nginx package (and dependencies). To apply the patch, you can simply run the Update Manager application.

If you don't want to use the Software Updater, you can open a terminal and enter the following commands (you will need to be root):

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes. You don't have to restart the PC in order to implement this fix.
