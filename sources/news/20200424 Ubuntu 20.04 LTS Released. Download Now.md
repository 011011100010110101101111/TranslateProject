If you were already using Ubuntu 19.10, you may not notice a lot of noticeable differences – but the list of improvements that I’m looking at is indeed impressive.

If you’re curious about what’s new, I’ll mention a few key highlights for this release.

### Ubuntu 20.04: What’s new?

Considering the previous 18.04 LTS release, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS involves a lot of visual changes and under-the-hood improvements as well.

Of course, with the addition of [GNOME 3.36][2], a major visual upgrade and the performance improvement is quite obvious. Here’s a video highlighting what’s new in Ubuntu 20.04:

You can also dive into one of our articles highlighting [new features of Ubuntu 20.04][3], if you’re curious.

In either case, let me just give you some highlights:

  * GNOME 3.36 is the default desktop

  * The new Yaru theme is gorgeous, comes in dark mode as well
  * You won’t have to see the Amazon app anymore, it’s gone for good!
  * Improved [ZFS][4] support

In case you’re new to Ubuntu and have questions about Ubuntu 20.04, we also have a quick [Ubuntu 20.04 FAQ][7] article for you.

### Upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 from 18.04 and 19.10

If you are already using Ubuntu 18.04 or 19.10, you can easily upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 from within your system.

This way, your files and most of the applications settings remain as it is while you start using the new version without reinstalling it from the ISO.

You can read this detailed tutorial to learn [how to upgrade Ubuntu to a newer version][8].

Please note that if you are using Lubuntu 18.04, you must not upgrade to Lubuntu 20.04. Lubuntu 18.04 used Lxde desktop while later versions use LXQt desktop. Upgrading this way result in conflicts and possible broken system.

### Download Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

You can grab the ISO or the torrent file, depending on what you prefer:

[Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (ISO)][9]

[Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Torrent)][10]

Please follow this tutorial to learn [how to install Ubuntu][11].

If you don’t find the latest ISO/torrent file listed in their respective official sites, simply head to [cdimages.ubuntu.com][18] to find all the flavours listed.
