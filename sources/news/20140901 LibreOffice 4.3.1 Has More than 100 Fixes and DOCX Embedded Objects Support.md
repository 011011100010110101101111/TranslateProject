**The Document Foundation announces that the stable version of LibreOffice 4.3.1 has been released and is now available for download.**

The developers from The Document Foundation have released a new update for the 4.3 branch of LibreOffice and they have implemented quite a few fixes and other various changes. The development cycle for this latest update has been rather short and the devs managed to repair most of the issues that have been found.

LibreOffice 4.3.1 is just maintenance release, which means that the focus has been about the bugs found so far. Don't expect to find anything extraordinary, but you should upgrade the software nonetheless.

"The Document Foundation announces LibreOffice 4.3.1, the first minor release of LibreOffice 4.3 'fresh' family, with over 100 fixes (including patches for two CVEs, backported to LibreOffice 4.2.6-secfix, which is also available for download now)."

"All LibreOffice users are invited to update their installation as soon as possible to avoid security issues. This includes users who are running LibreOffice 4.2.6 as originally released on August, 5th 2014. LibreOffice 4.3.1 and LibreOffice 4.2.6 will be shown on stage at the LibreOffice Conference in Bern, from September 3 to September 5, with a large number of sessions about development, community, marketing and migrations," reads the announcement made by The Linux Foundation.

According to the changelog, editing the text search with expanded fields is now working properly, the static value array for OOXML chart is now handled correctly, bullets now have the color as the following text by default, ww8import no longer creates a pagedesc if a continuous section changes margins, the 0 font height is now handled just like outdev, it's now possible to import OLE objects in the header with background wrapping, the XLSX export of revisions has been fixed in order to get it to work in Excel, and borders around data labels are now supported.

Also, the table style for lastRow is now correctly applied, the rulers now have app-background by default, the graphics are now swapped in on DrawingML::WriteImage, the redundant 'Preferences' label has been removed in order to save some space, page breaks in tables are now ignored during the RTF import, some of the style hierarchy has been reworked, Data Statistics no longer crashes with any entry, DOCX embedded objects are now supported, and numerous other improvements have been made.

More details about this release can be found in the official [announcement][1].
