Red Hat公司获得FeedHenry提供的8200万美元来推动手机开发
================================================================================
> 这是Red Hat公司进入手机开发领域的一次关键收获。

Red Hat公司的JBoss开发者工具事业部一直注重于企业开发，而忽略了手机方面。而如今这一切将随着Red Hat公司宣布从手机开发供应商 [FeedHenry][1] 手中获得8200万美元现金开始发生改变。这笔交易将在Red Hat公司2015财年的第三季度结束。Red Hat公司会在美国东部时间9月18号的4点公布它2015财年第二季度的收入。

Mike Piech, general manager of Middleware at Red Hat, told Datamation that upon the deal's closing FeedHenry's employees will become Red Hat employees

FeedHenry's development platform enables application developers to rapidly build mobile application for Android, IOS, Windows Phone and BlackBerry. The FeedHenry platform leverages Node.js programming architecture, which is not an area where JBoss has had much exposure in the past.

"The acquisition of FeedHenry significantly expands Red Hat's support for and engagement in Node.js," Piech said.

Piech Red Hat's OpenShift Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) technology already has a Node.js cartridge. Additionally Red Hat Enterprise Linux ships a tech preview of node.js as part of the Red Hat Software Collections.

While node.js itself is open source, not all of FeedHenry's technology is currently available under an open source license. As has been Red Hat's policy throughout its entire history, it is now committing to making FeedHenry open source as well.

"As we've done with other acquisitions, open sourcing the technology we acquire is a priority for Red Hat, and we have no reason to expect that approach will change with FeedHenry," Piech said.

Red Hat's last major acquisition of a company with non open source technology was with [ManageIQ][2] for $104 million back in 2012. In May of this year, Red Hat launched the ManageIQ open-source project, opening up development and code of the formerly closed-source cloud management technology.

From an integration standpoint, Red Hat is not yet providing full details of precisely where FeedHenry will fit it.

"We've already identified a number of areas where FeedHenry and Red Hat's existing technology and products can be better aligned and integrated," Piech said. "We'll share more details as we develop the roadmap over the next 90 days."
