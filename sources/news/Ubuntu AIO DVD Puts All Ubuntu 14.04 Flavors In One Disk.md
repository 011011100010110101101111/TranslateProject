Ubuntu AIO DVD Puts All Ubuntu 14.04 Flavors In One Disk
================================================================================
Ubuntu has several official flavors based on different desktop environments. The default Ubuntu comes with Unity desktop where as Kubuntu is with [KDE][1], Lubuntu with [LXDE][2], Xubuntu with [Xfce][3]. There are some other flavors as well but these are the most popular official desktop flavors.

How do you choose which Ubuntu is the best for you? One way is to download the ISO of the Ubuntu flavor and [give it a run via live USB][4]. But that would mean downloading several ISOs and writing them one by one in USB/disk. A little tiresome, isn’t it?

This is where [Ubuntu AIO][5] (all in one) DVD comes in picture. A project started by some members of [Start Ubuntu][6] team, Ubuntu AIO DVD lets you try Ubuntu Unity, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Kubuntu and Ubuntu Gnome in one single live disk.

Of course there are few downside of Ubuntu AIO. First it’s too big in size, around 4.7 GB. It won’t fit on a standard 4GB USB key. Further it has only 64 bit version of Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Ubuntu Gnome and only 32 bit version of Xubuntu and Lubuntu. Despite the shortcomings, it’s a nice effort to ease selection of the apt Ubuntu.
