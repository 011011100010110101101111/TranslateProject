> The creator of the Linux kernel now has a UHD display

**Linus Torvalds is the creator of the Linux Kernel, he advocated for years against Microsoft's practices and he often talked about Windows. These are just some of the reasons why it's funny to see him thank Microsoft, even if it's probably done sarcastically.**

The rhetoric regarding the Linux vs. Windows subject has subsided a great deal in the last few years. There have been some issues with UEFI and other similar problems, but for the most part things have quieted down.

There is no one left at the Redmond campus to call Linux a cancer and no one is making fun of Windows for crashing all the time. In fact, there has been some sort of reconciliation between the two sides, which seems to benefit everyone.

It's not like Microsoft is ready to adopt the Linux kernel for their operating system, but the new management of the company talks about Linux as a friend, especially in the cloud.

They can no longer ignore it, even if they want to. The same happened with Linus Torvalds who hasn't said anything bad about Microsoft and Windows for a long time, and that is a good thing.

### Linus Torvalds saying "thanks" to Microsoft is not something you see every day ###

The creator of the Linux kernel talked about a great Black Friday deal he got from the Microsoft store, for a UHD monitor. He shared this piece of info on Google+ and some of the users also found it amusing to read that he's giving sincere thanks to Microsoft for their great deal.

"Whee. Just installed a new monitor. 3840x2160 resolution - it's the Dell 28" UHD panel - for $299 (€241) thanks to Microsoft's black Friday deal. Thanks MS! Ok, I have to admit that it's not actually a great panel: very clear color shifts off-center, 30Hz refresh etc. But still - I'm a nut for resolution, and at $299 (€241) I decided that this will carry me over until better panels start showing up at good prices," wrote Linus on [Google+][1].

In the meantime, he is also working on the latest kernel branch, 3.18, which will probably be released sometime at the end of this week. It's not clear how things will evolve after that, especially given the fact that the holidays are approaching fast, and devs might be a little sluggish when it comes to pushing patches and new features for the next 3.19 branch.
