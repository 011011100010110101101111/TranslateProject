Meet the 12 Ubuntu 14.10 Wallpaper Contest Winners (So Far)
================================================================================
Get ready to glance over a group of images you’ll be seeing a whole lot more of in the coming months. Yes, the winners of the [Ubuntu 14.10 Wallpaper contest][1] have been unveiled.

Well, announced ‘sort of’. So far twelve backgrounds have been formally selected to ship on the Ubuntu 14.10 release.

Having sifted through an entry pool of almost 400 images the judging panel made up of April’s winning artists have chosen a visually varied and colourful collection. I know I say it every 6 months, but this one looks to be the best yet (and not just because one or two of [our own favourites made it in][2]!)

### Meet The Winners ###

You can see the current crop of selected images below. Emphasis is on current for now as, according to the contest organiser Iain Farrell, [**he is**][3] “…awaiting a couple from people but if they don’t come back to me we’ll have to go without!” .
