**Webmin, a web-based interface for system administration for Unix, has just reached version 1.690 and is available for download.**

With Webmin and with the help of any modern browser, users can set up user accounts, Apache servers, DNS, file sharing, and much more. The developers of Webmin have made regular updates to this piece of software. This latest version is not a major one, but some interesting fixes have been implemented.

According to the developers, a number of security fixes for XSS attacks in popup windows have been added, the Fail2Ban module has been added and it's used for blocking the IP addresses of systems that have many failed logins, the handling of the url_rewrite_children directive in the Squid module has been fixed in order to support all the process count options, and the support for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS has been improved.

Also, a number of security issues that could have been exploited by untrusted Webmin users in the PHP Configuration and Webalizer modules, the File Manager module Java applet has been signed, the UI library has been improved, and more.

A complete list of changes and improvements can be found in the official [announcement][1]. You can download Webmin 1.690 right now from the website.
