The Linux Foundation [announced][1] its mid-year individual membership drive and promotion. For each new membership between 01 June to 11:59 p.m. PT on June 30, 2014, Code.org will receive $25.

Code.org is a non-profit organization dedicated to the expansion of computer science by making it available in more schools and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Its vision is to provide the opportunity of learning computer science to every school student. Code.org identifies with the Linux Foundation’s mission to increase opportunities for people to learn programming of all types.

Amanda McPherson, CMO at The Linux Foundation explains – “Many of today’s Linux professionals got started as students, tinkering with computers and writing simple programs during college. By helping extend individual membership contributions this month to Code.org, we hope the community can support Linux and the work of Linux creator Linus Torvalds while helping to increase access to computer science education for the next generation of Linux developers and SysAdmins”.

Learning and education are top priorities at The Linux Foundation too. It recently announced the first ‘Introduction to Linux’ Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), which is free for all. More than 140,000 people already enrolled for the first class that begins this August. It also offers and organizes various training programs.

The Linux Foundation memberships support the advancement of Linux and open source community. As additional perks, members also receive exclusive benefits that include 20 percent off LinuxCon and CloudOpen registration; up to 10 percent off Linux Foundation training; a Linux.com email address (e.g. john@linux.com); employee purchase pricing from Dell, HP and Lenovo; up to 35 percent off O’Reilly books and e-books; and a variety of other discounts.

The membership fee per year is $99. For students it is $25 and includes the same benefits as individual members. To sign up, visit:
