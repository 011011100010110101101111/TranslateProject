Yes! You read it correct. The minimalist Linux distribution **CrunchBang Linux has been discontinued**.

CrunchBang Linux, popularly known for its abbreviated symbol #!, is based on Debian and comes with [Openbox][1] window manager. The dark themed Linux was/is a popular Linux choice for many experience Linux users.

### CrunchBang discontinued for “it no longer holds any value” ###

[Announcing][2] that CrunchBang will no longer be developed, head of the project Philip Newborough said that when he started the project, Linux world was different place. He mentioned that there was no ‘competition’ in the same ilk at that time but with the advancement of Linux distros like Lubuntu, Crunchbang doesn’t hold the same value.

> For anyone who has been involved with Linux for the past ten years or so, I’m sure they’ll agree that things have moved on. Whilst some things have stayed exactly the same, others have changed beyond all recognition. It’s called progress, and for the most part, progress is a good thing. That said, when progress happens, some things get left behind, and for me, CrunchBang is something that I need to leave behind. I’m leaving it behind because I honestly believe that it no longer holds any value, and whilst I could hold on to it for sentimental reasons, I don’t believe that would be in the best interest of its users, who would benefit from using vanilla Debian.

### What after CrunchBang demise? ###

As happened in case of [Pear OS][3], CrunchBang forums will stay online. Downloads are available for now but will be removed in near future. Philip mentioned that he was excited about some of his incoming projects and his day job. I wish him luck in his future endeavors. It is sad to see the death of a nice Linux distribution like CrunchBang.
