Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition Announced and It's a Beast
========================================================

## Canonical and Meizu have just revealed that Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition will be available for pre-order during Mobile World Congress 2016.

It's been a while since we last heard something from Meizu, but it looks like the collaboration between Canonical and the Chinese hardware maker is still alive. From the looks of it, the previous Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition was only a limited release, so only a small number of devices have been sold.

We can only hope that Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition will be made available in greater numbers, especially since it's a much newer phone that's still supported by Meizu.

This latest Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition is the fifth official device that comes with Ubuntu Touch, and we'll likely see many more phones and maybe tablets with this operating system landing in 2016.

##Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition is a beast

Canonical says that it's the most powerful Ubuntu smartphone launched to date, and they are right, not to mention that it's also the biggest, if we don't count the tablet. Meizu PRO 5 features a Samsung Exynos 7420 Octa-core processor, a 5.7-inch 1920x1080 AMOLED display, Corning Gorilla Glass 3, and LPDDR4 memory technology.

Many of you will probably ask if this new phone is also capable of desktop convergence, and it looks that users are in luck.

"Canonical remains committed to the vision of reinventing personal computing through a single, adaptive platform for all personal device form factors. As such, while the PRO 5 lacks MHL output, the software running on the Meizu PRO 5 is the latest code which also powers recently announced tablets and other devices and is capable of providing a traditional desktop experience," the company explained.

Meizu PRO 5 was initially launched back in September 2015. Users will also get a 21 MP back camera, and the phone can shoot video at 2160p and 30fps. It also comes with a fingerprint sensor and a Li-Ion 3050 mAh battery with fast charging.

For now, the phone will only be available in China and Europe, and the preorders will be opened during the Mobile World Congress 2016 that takes place between February 22 and 25.
