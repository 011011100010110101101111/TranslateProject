================================================================================

Git 2.2.1 was released this afternoon to fix a critical security vulnerability in Git clients. Fortunately, the vulnerability doesn't plague Unix/Linux users but rather OS X and Windows.

Today's Git vulnerability affects those using the Git client on case-insensitive file-systems. On case-insensitive platforms like Windows and OS X, committing to .Git/config could overwrite the user's .git/config and could lead to arbitrary code execution. Fortunately with most Phoronix readers out there running Linux, this isn't an issue thanks to case-sensitive file-systems.

Besides the attack vector from case insensitive file-systems, Windows and OS X's HFS+ would map some strings back to .git too if certain characters are present, which could lead to overwriting the Git config file. Git 2.2.1 addresses these issues.

More details via the [Git 2.2.1 release announcement][1] and [GitHub has additional details][2].
