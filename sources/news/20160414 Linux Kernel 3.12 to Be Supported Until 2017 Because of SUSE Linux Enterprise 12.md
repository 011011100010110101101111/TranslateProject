Linux Kernel 3.12 to Be Supported Until 2017 Because of SUSE Linux Enterprise 12
==================================================================================

>Linux kernel developer Jiri Slaby has announced the release of the fifty-eighth maintenance build of the long-term supported Linux 3.12 kernel series, as well as a modification to its EOL status.

Linux kernel 3.12.58 LTS is now available, and those running it on their Linux kernel-based operating system must update as soon as possible. And the good news is that the Linux 3.12 branch is here to stay for one more year, until 2017, because SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) 12 Service Pack 1 is based on it.

"Since SLE12-SP1 is based upon 3.12 and its EOL is in 2017, move the EOL of 3.12 to 2017 too," said Jiri Slaby in a [patch announcement][1] sent to one of Linux kernel's mailing lists, where he has also revealed the "end of life" statuses for other kernel branches, such as August 2016 for Linux 3.14, January 2017 for Linux 3.18, or September 2017 for Linux 4.1.
