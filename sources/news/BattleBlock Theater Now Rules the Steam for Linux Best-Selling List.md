**The Steam for Linux platform has been receiving some new titles in the past couple of weeks and a few of them managed to get pretty high up in the best-selling list.**

**Small World 2** take the tenth place and it’s a new entry in this exclusive list. This is a title based on the fantasy board game with the same name and it’s probably the only one in this genre that has a Linux version.

**Football Manager 2014** fell into the ninth position, but given the fact that it’s one of the most expensive games on the Steam for Linux, we can safely say that it’s still doing quite well. This is a game that needs no introduction and that is regarded as the best of its kind.

**Counter-Strike: Source**, a game that combines the gameplay from the original Counter-Strike with the power of the Source engine, has managed to get back in the best-selling top on Steam for Linux, in place number eight.

**Guns of Icarus Online**, a multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Muse Games for multiple platforms, including Linux, is now in the seventh place and it even comes with a 75% discount.

**Left 4 Dead 2**, the cooperative FPS developed by Valve, is still one of the best games on the Linux platform and the sixth place is a just one.

**Starbound**, a procedurally generated adventure game developed by Chucklefish Ltd. in which the player takes on the role of a character who’s just fled from their home planet, only to crash-land on another, is in the fifth position. This is still under development and the fact that people are buying it before it’s even finished says a lot about the quality.

**Kerbal Space Program**, a multi-genre game in which the players have to create their own space project and make a successful launch without killing the astronauts, is now in the fourth position.

**Garry's Mod**, a physics sandbox that’s not even a game per say, is really hanging on and it remains in the third place, which is weird if we thing about it. It doesn’t have a single player campaign, but promise complete freedom to its users.

**Rust**, a first-person survival game that takes place in a persistent universe, is no longer in the first place, but the second one is not all that bad. It’s still in development and there is no indication when the final version will be released.

The first place in the best-selling list of games on Steam for Linux is a new entry called **BattleBlock Theater**. This is a 2D action platformer developed and published by The Behemoth studio that features an interesting level design and beautiful graphics.

Enjoy!
