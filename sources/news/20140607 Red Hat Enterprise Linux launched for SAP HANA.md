Red Hat Enterprise Linux launched for SAP HANA
================================================================================
Red Hat has expanded the company’s strategic alliance with SAP AG to make it easier for customers to adopt and run the SAP Data Management portfolio, including the SAP HANA platform, SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (SAP ASE), SAP IQ software, and the SAP SQL Anywhere suite on Red Hat’s open source solutions.

The expanded collaboration is expected to enable real-time, in-memory innovation by providing an open, scalable, integrated and highly-available platform for solutions from SAP along with those that are custom-built in an effort to expand customer choice when it comes to fueling business performance and helping enterprises realize increased value from cloud computing and big data.

Steve Lucas, president, Platform Solutions, SAP AG added: “By joining forces with Red Hat to enable SAP HANA on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, we plan to give our customers an additional choice upon which to base deployments of SAP solutions; an open, flexible and scalable platform that is intended to support customers’ data management needs across on-premise and cloud environments.”

As the foundation of the enhanced partnership, Red Hat Enterprise Linux is now available and qualified for production use of SAP HANA and supported by partners’ SAP-certified hardware solutions. SAP HANA enables customers to capture business transactions to help make smarter, faster decisions through real-time analysis and reporting combined with dramatically accelerated business processes. Customers can now also enjoy expanded choice when it comes to their deployments of SAP HANA to experience the reliability, quality and stability offered by Red Hat Enterprise Linux. They can also standardize deployments of SAP solutions on Red Hat’s high-performing, secure and open platform, helping to ensure consistency of operations across the business.
