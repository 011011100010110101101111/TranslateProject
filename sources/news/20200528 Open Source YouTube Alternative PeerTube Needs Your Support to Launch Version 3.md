Open Source YouTube Alternative PeerTube Needs Your Support to Launch Version 3
======

[PeerTube][1] (developed by [Framasoft][2]) is a free and open-source decentralized alternative to YouTube somewhat like [LBRY][3]. As the name suggests, it relies on [peer-to-peer connections][4] to operate the video hosting services.

You can also choose to self-host your instance and also have access to videos from other instances (a federated network, just like [Mastodon][5]).

It is being actively developed for a few years now. And, to take it up a notch, they have decided to launch a crowdfunding campaign for the next major release.

The funding campaign will help them develop v3.0 of PeerTube with some amazing key features planned for the release this fall.

### PeerTube: Brief Overview

In addition to what I just mentioned above, PeerTube is a fully-functional peer to peer video platform. The best thing about it is — it’s open-source and free. So, you can check them out on [GitHub][7] if you want.

You can watch their official video here:

**Note:** You need to be cautious about your IP address if you have concerns about that on PeerTube (try using one of the [best VPNs available][8]).

### PeerTube’s Crowdfunding Campaign For v3 Launch

You’ll be excited to know that the crowdfunding campaign of **€60,000** already managed to **get 10,000 Euros on Day 1** (at the time of writing this).

Now, coming to the details. The campaign aims to focus on gathering **funds for the next 6 months of development for a v3 release planned for November 2020.** It looks like a lot of work for a single full-time developer — but no matter whether they reach the funding goal, they intend to release the v3 with the existing funds they have.

In their [announcement post][9], PeerTube team mentioned:

> We feel like we need to develop it, that we have to. Imposing a condition stating « if we do not get our 60,000€, then there will not be a v3 » here, would be a lie, marketing manipulation : this is not the kind of relation we want to maintain with you.

Next, let’s talk about the new features they’ve planned to introduced in the next 6 months:

  * Upon reaching the **€10,000 goal,** they plan to work on introducing a globalized video index to make it easier to search for videos across multiple instances.
  * With **€**20,000 goal, PeerTube will dedicate one month on improving the moderation tools to make the best out of it.
  * With 40,000 goal, they would work on the UX/UI of playlists. So, it will look better when you try to embed a playlist. In addition to this, the plugin system will be improved to make it easier to contribute to PeerTube’s code.
  * With the end of the campaign reaching 60,000 goal, PeerTube’s live-streaming feature will be introduced.



You can also find the details of their [roadmap on their site][10].

### Wrapping Up

The ability to have a global inter-connected video index among multiple instances is something that was needed and it will also allow you to configure your own index.

The content moderation tool improvement is also a huge deal because it’s not that easy to manage a decentralized network of video hosting services. While they aim to prevent censorship, a strict moderation is required to make PeerTube a comfortable place to watch videos.

Even though I’m not sure about how useful PeerTube’s live-streaming feature will be, at launch. It is going to be something exciting to keep an eye out for.

We at It’s FOSS made a token donation of 25 Euro. I would also encourage you to donate and help this open source achieve their financial goal for version 3 development.
