**WinAte, the theme pack that will turn your Ubuntu and Debian installation into a Windows 7 of Windows 8 look-alike, has just received a new update.**

There was a time when it was easy to change the look of most Linux distributions and make them look like a Windows counterpart, but that time has passed. There are only a handful that can still be modified, and Ubuntu and Debian Jessie are among them.

“With this brand-new WinAte - Windows 7/8 Transformation Pack for LXDE - you will be able to get all the icons and overall appearance of Windows to your GNU/Linux box, without spending lots of resources nor having to adapt old Gnome 2 themes. Everything works just by executing the install.sh script. Just do that, logout and login again, and there should be a different feeling in the whole system,” reads the official website.

The package has a few dependencies that are very easy to meet: gtk2-engines-murrine, gtk2-engines-pixbuf, and compton. The installation is very simple and the instructions can be followed by anyone.

This theme is probably the closest that users will ever going to get to Windows 7 or Windows 8 in term of look, but it ca be used to help people migrate to Linux more easily.

You can download the WinAte - Windows 7/8 Theme pack from [gnome-look.org][1].
