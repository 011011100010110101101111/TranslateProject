Ubuntu extends its Windows Azure availability with full Juju support
==========
Along with the powerful desktop, Canonical is seriously involved in the cloud, where it is creating innovative technologies populating numerous and diverse cloud structures.

[Juju][1] is an advanced Ubuntu technology that, paired with Juju charms and user-friendly Juju GUI, allows companies, teams of developers and users to deploy, manage, configure and maintain services in the cloud.

Canonical has [announced][2] that Juju fully supports now deploying services on [Windows Azure][3], extending the innovative cloud technology to more and more availabilities, therefore, meeting more and more needs spanning rich cloud demands, "today, Canonical, in cooperation with Microsoft, is announcing that Juju fully supports deploying services on Ubuntu into Windows Azure. This means that Ubuntu users can use Juju with its intuitive GUI to design and deploy sophisticated application infrastructure instantly into Windows Azure".

Its Azure availability permits now the handy deployment of more than **100 Juju charms** (usable services) into Windows Azure's Ubuntu instances.

As a consequence, there are now available Azure-ready certified [Ubuntu images][4] for all supported Ubuntu releases.

"Juju support for Windows Azure is a **major milestone**, as it underscores our commitment to delivering ease of use and portability of applications across the most popular cloud providers. Being able to design and deploy services using the same tool and process, irrespective of the deployment target, is invaluable. Being able to take a whole set of applications and reproduce the exact same setup on another cloud within minutes gives cloud users real choice".
