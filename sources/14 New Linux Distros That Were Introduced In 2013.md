The year 2013 has been a big one for the open source industry. With the rise of the Android OS, which owns over 85 per cent of the market share in the mobile devices segment, Linux has come to the forefront like never before. Corroborating the increasing reports of the rise in popularity of Linux-based distributions, 13 new distros emerged this year. In case you happened to miss them, take a look!

1. **[Slackel Linux][1]**: This distro is based on Slackware Linux and the Salix OS. It uses KDE as its default desktop environment.

2. **[SalentOS][2]**: Based on the popular Ubuntu operating system, this distribution uses Openbox as its default windows manager. It is aimed at beginners and is a comparatively light Linux distro.

3. **[Linux Lite][3]**: This lightweight Linux-based operating system is aimed at beginners and uses the XFCE desktop environment.

4. **[Kali Linux][4]**: The resurrection of BackTrack Linux, the well known distro, was brought around by Kali Linux. This is a penetration testing distribution that has gained favour in the community since it was launched.
