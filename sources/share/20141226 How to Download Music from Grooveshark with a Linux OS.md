**Grooveshark is a great online platform for people who want to listen to music, and there are a number of ways to download music from there. Groovesquid is just one of the applications that let users get music from Grooveshark, and it's multiplatform.**

If there is a service that streams something online, then there is a way to download the stuff that you are just watching or listening. As it turns out, it's not that difficult and there are a ton of solutions, no matter the platform. For example, there are dozens of YouTube downloaders and it stands to reason that it's not all that difficult to get stuff from Grooveshark either.

Now, there is the problem of legality. Like many other applications out there, Groovesquid is not actually illegal. It's the user's fault if they do something illegal with an application. The same reasoning can be applied to apps like utorrent or Bittorrent. As long as you don't touch copyrighted material, there are no problems in using Groovesquid.

### Groovesquid is fast and efficient ###

The only problem that you could find with Groovesquid is the fact that it's based on Java and that's never a good sign. This is a good way to ensure that an application runs on all the platforms, but it's an issue when it comes to the interface. It's not great, but it doesn't really matter all that much for users, especially since the app is doing a great job.

There is one caveat though. Groovesquid is a free application, but in order to remain free, it has to display an ad on the right side of the menu. This shouldn't be a problem for most people, but it's a good idea to mention that right from the start.

From a usability point of view, the application is pretty straightforward. Users can download a single song by entering the link in the top field, but the purpose of that field can be changed by accessing the small drop-down menu to its left. From there, it's possible to change to Song, Popular, Albums, Playlist, and Artist. Some of the options provide access to things like the most popular song on Grooveshark and other options allow you to download an entire playlist, for example.

You can download Groovesquid 0.7.0

- [jar][1] File size: 3.8 MB
- [tar.gz][2] File size: 549 KB

You will get a Jar file and all you have to do is to make it executable and let Java do the rest.
