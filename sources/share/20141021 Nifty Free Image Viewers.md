Nifty Free Image Viewers
================================================================================
One of my favorite adages is "A picture is worth a thousand words". It refers to the notion that a still image can convey a complex idea. Images can portray a lot of information quickly and more efficiently than text. They capture memories, and never let you forget something you want to remember, and refresh it in your memory.

Images are part of every day internet usage, and are particularly important for social media engagement. A good image viewer is an essential part of any operating system.

Linux offers a vast collection of open source small utilities that perform functions ranging from the obvious to the bizarre. It is the quality and selection of these tools that help Linux stand out as a productive environment. This is particularly true when it comes to image viewers. There are so many image viewers that are available for Linux that it can make selection difficult.

An image viewer that is not included in this roundup but is worth a mention is Fragment Image Viewer. It is released under a proprietary license (yes, I know!), and would not install on Ubuntu. But it certainly looks interesting! One for the future, particularly if the developers release it under an open source license.

Now, let's explore the 13 image viewers at hand. With one exception, each of them is released under an open source license. As there is a lot of information to detail, I have departed from a roundup on a single page, but instead have devoted a page for each image viewer, with a full description of the software, an in-depth analysis of its features, a screenshot of the software in action, together with links to relevant resources and reviews.
