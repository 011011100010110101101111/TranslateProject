FISH – A smart and user-friendly command line shell for Linux
================================================================================
The friendly interactive shell (FISH). fish is a user friendly command line shell intended mostly for interactive use. A shell is a program used to execute other programs.

### FISH Features ###

#### Autosuggestions ####

fish suggests commands as you type based on history and completions, just like a web browser. Watch out, Netscape Navigator 4.0!

#### Glorious VGA Color ####

fish natively supports term256, the state of the art in terminal technology. You'll have an astonishing 256 colors available for use!

#### Sane Scripting ####

fish is fully scriptable, and its syntax is simple, clean, and consistent. You'll never write esac again.

#### Web Based configuration ####

For those lucky few with a graphical computer, you can set your colors and view functions, variables, and history all from a web page.

#### Man Page Completions ####

Other shells support programmable completions, but only fish generates them automatically by parsing your installed man pages.

#### Works Out Of The Box ####

fish will delight you with features like tab completions and syntax highlighting that just work, with nothing new to learn or configure.
