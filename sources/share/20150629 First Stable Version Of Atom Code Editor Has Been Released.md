[Atom 1.0][1] is here. One of the [best open source code editors][2], [Atom][3] was available for public uses for almost a year but this is the first stable version of the most talked about text/code editor of recent times. Promoted as the “hackable text editor for 21st century”, this project of [Github][4] has already been downloaded 1.5 million times in the past and currently it has over 350,000 monthly active users.

### It’s been a long time ###

Rome was not built in a day and neither was Atom. Since it was first conceptualized in 2008 till the first stable release this month, it has taken several years and hundreds of contributors from across the globe, along with main developers working on Atom core. A quick look at the journey of Atom can be seen in the picture below:
