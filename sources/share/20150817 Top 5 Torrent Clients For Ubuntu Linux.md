Looking for the **best torrent client in Ubuntu**? Indeed there are a number of torrent clients available for desktop Linux. But which ones are the **best Ubuntu torrent clients** among them?

I am going to list top 5 torrent clients for Linux, which are lightweight, feature rich and have impressive GUI. Ease of installation and using is also a factor.

### Best torrent programs for Ubuntu ###

Since Ubuntu comes by default with Transmission, I am going to exclude it from the list. This doesn’t mean that Transmission doesn’t deserve to be on the list. Transmission is a good to have torrent client for Ubuntu and this is the reason why it is the default Torrent application in several Linux distributions, including Ubuntu.

----------

### Deluge ###

[Deluge][1] has been chosen as the best torrent client for Linux by Lifehacker and that speaks itself of the usefulness of Deluge. And it’s not just Lifehacker who is fan of Deluge, check out any forum and you’ll find a number of people admitting that Deluge is their favorite.

Fast, sleek and intuitive interface makes Deluge a hot favorite among Linux users.

Deluge is available in Ubuntu repositories and you can install it in Ubuntu Software Center or by using the command below:

    sudo apt-get install deluge

----------

### qBittorrent ###

As the name suggests, [qBittorrent][2] is the Qt version of famous [Bittorrent][3] application. You’ll see an interface similar to Bittorrent client in Windows, if you ever used it. Sort of lightweight and have all the standard features of a torrent program, qBittorrent is also available in default Ubuntu repository.

It could be installed from Ubuntu Software Center or using the command below:

    sudo apt-get install qbittorrent

----------

### Tixati ###

[Tixati][4] is another nice to have torrent client for Ubuntu. It has a default dark theme which might be preferred by many but not me. It has all the standard features that you can seek in a torrent client.

In addition to that, there are additional feature of data analysis. You can measure and analyze bandwidth and other statistics in nice charts.

### Vuze ###

[Vuze][6] is favorite torrent application of a number of Linux as well as Windows users. Apart from the standard features, you can search for torrents directly in the application. You can also subscribe to episodic content so that you won’t have to search for new contents as you can see it in your subscription in sidebar.

It also comes with a video player that can play HD videos with subtitles and all. But I don’t think you would like to use it over the better video players such as VLC.

Vuze can be installed from Ubuntu Software Center or using the command below:

    sudo apt-get install vuze

----------

### Frostwire ###

[Frostwire][7] is the torrent application you might want to try. It is more than just a simple torrent client. Also available for Android, you can use it to share files over WiFi.

You can search for torrents from within the application and play them inside the application. In addition to the downloaded files, it can browse your local media and have them organized inside the player. The same is applicable for the Android version.

An additional feature is that Frostwire also provides access to legal music by indi artists. You can download them and listen to it, for free, for legal.

- [Download Frostwire][8]

### Honorable mention ###

On Windows, uTorrent (pronounced mu torrent) is my favorite torrent application. While uTorrent may be available for Linux, I deliberately skipped it from the list because installing and using uTorrent in Linux is neither easy nor does it provide a complete application experience (runs with in web browser).

You can read about uTorrent installation in Ubuntu [here][9].

#### Quick tip: ####

Most of the time, torrent applications do not start by default. You might want to change this behavior. Read this post to learn [how to manage startup applications in Ubuntu][10].
