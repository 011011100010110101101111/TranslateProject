**Claws Mail is an open source email client that is fast, easy to use, and full of interesting features and that is gaining some traction in the Linux community. The developers have pushed another big update for this application and it would be a very good idea to upgrade.**

Some users might not know this, but Claws Mail is actually a very old application. It's been around for more than 13 years, but it operated under the name of Sylpheed-Claws. It was forked a while back, and since then, the new project has managed to become a much better alternative.

There are quite a few email clients for Linux right now and they are all fighting for supremacy, although it's been done in a very polite fashion. Claws Mail is now being integrated in quite a few Linux distros by default, and this is actually very good news for fans of the app.

### What are some of the features in Claws Mail 3.11.0 ###

Just like any other application that deals with online connections and online protocols, Claws Mail has also been affected by the recent vulnerabilities identified in the community, like POODLE for example. The developers had a very busy schedule and the changelog reflects this entirely.

"A new version of the RSSyl plugin, completely redesigned and rewritten. Migration from the previous version is automatic, it has a new storage format in ~/.claws-mail/RSSyl/ (hierarchical directories instead of flat file format). It uses the expat library instead of libxml2 for parsing feed data."

"Due to popular demand, use of the Up key in the message body in the Compose window stops at the top of the message body and does not continue up to the header fields. This reverts the behavior introduced in version 3.10.0," say the developers in the [announcement][1].

Also, users can relax now because the POODLE vulnerability has been closed in the email client, feat that has been achieved by disabling all the SSLv3 connections.

The TAB address completion has also received some improvements and it should work much better, especially for New Messages, nagivation with the help of arrows has been tweaked, and numerous smaller enhancements have been made.

The developers have repositories for most of the major distributions out there, but you can always install it from source. You can check the official announcement for more details about this release.
