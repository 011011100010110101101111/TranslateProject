Themes are the best way to customize your Linux desktop. If you [install GNOME on Ubuntu 14.04][1] or 14.10, you might want to change the default theme and give it a different look. To help you in this task, I have compiled here a **list of best GNOME shell themes for Ubuntu** or any other Linux OS that has GNOME shell installed on it. But before we see the list, let’s first see how to change install new themes in GNOME Shell.

### Install themes in GNOME Shell ###

To install new themes in GNOME with Ubuntu, you can use Gnome Tweak Tool which is available in software repository in Ubuntu. Open a terminal and use the following command:

    sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool

Alternatively, you can use themes by putting them in ~/.themes directory. I have written a detailed tutorial on [how to install and use themes in GNOME Shell][2], in case you need it.

### Best GNOME Shell themes ###

The themes listed here are tested on GNOME Shell 3.10.4 but it should work for all version of GNOME 3 and higher. For the sake of mentioning, the themes are not in any kind of priority order. Let’s have a look at the best GNOME themes:

#### Numix ####

No list can be completed without the mention of [Numix themes][3]. These themes got so popular that it encouraged [Numix team to work on a new Linux OS, Ozon][4]. Considering their design work with Numix theme, it won’t be exaggeration to call it one of the [most beautiful Linux OS][5] releasing in near future.

To install Numix theme in Ubuntu based distributions, use the following commands:

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:numix/ppa
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install numix-icon-theme-circle

#### Elegance Colors ####

[Moka][7] is another mesmerizing theme that is always included in the list of beautiful themes. Designed by the same developer who gave us Unity Tweak Tool, Moka is a must try:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:moka/stable

    sudo apt-get install moka-gnome-shell-theme

#### Viva ####

Faience has been a popular theme for quite some time and rightly so. You can install Faience using the PPA below for GNOME 3.10 and higher.

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tiheum/equinox
    sudo apt-get update

![](http://itsfoss.itsfoss.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Paper_GTK_Theme.jpeg)

Ever since Google talked about Material Design, people have been going gaga over it. Paper GTK theme, by Sam Hewitt (of Moka Project), is inspired by Google Material design and currently under development. Which means you will not have the best experience with Paper at the moment. But if your a bit experimental, like me, you can definitely give it a try.

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:snwh/pulp
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install paper-gtk-theme

That concludes my list. If you are trying to give a different look to your Ubuntu, you should also try the list of [best icon themes for Ubuntu 14.04][10].

How do you find this list of **best GNOME Shell themes**? Which one is your favorite among the one listed here? And if it’s not listed here, do let us know which theme you think is the best GNOME Shell theme.
