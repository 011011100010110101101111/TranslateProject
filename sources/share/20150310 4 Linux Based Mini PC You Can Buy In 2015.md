================================================================================

Mini PCs, in my opinion, will takeover the traditional desktop computers in near future. Traditional desktop has a bulky CPU which takes a lot of space with its fan running like a blower. The mini PCs, on the other hand, are tiny and compact. With hardly 4″ or 5″ in size, they can be easily placed on a table.

Moreover, these mini PCs are fanless which is an added virtue. Of course, you can buy fanless regular desktops but the space consumption is still an issue. Personally, I find the mini PC cute in looks. If you are not a gamer and thinking of buying a new desktop PC, I’ll highly recommend you to **buy a Linux based mini PC**.

If you go by my recommendation and consider buying it, you might wonder what options do you have. Worry not. In this post we shall see four **Linux based Mini PC that you can buy in 2015**.

### What’s your pick? ###

I have deliberately not included [Raspberry Pi 2][8] or other Linux microcomputer such as [Intel’s Compute Stick][9]. The reason is that I do not think that micro-computers fall in the same categories as mini PCs.

What do you think? Are you tempted to replace your desktop with a mini PC? Is there another player which I missed in this list of **best Linux based mini PCs**? Do share your views.
