Ubuntu With XFCE vs Xubuntu Linux
=========================================================

Ubuntu vs Xubuntu. Ubuntu has a classy desktop experience and great applications. Xubuntu is lightweight, fast and customisable. Which is best for you.
---------------------------------------------------------

![](http://f.tqn.com/y/linux/1/W/T/J/1/ubuntudesktop.png)

This isn't a straight forward Ubuntu is better than Xubuntu or Xubuntu is better than Ubuntu article.

This article will also show Ubuntu users how to get to a base XFCE desktop and also how to install the complete Xubuntu desktop.

[Ubuntu][1] and [Xubuntu][2] are created for different purposes and what I aim to highlight here is when and why you would use Ubuntu and when you would use Xubuntu.

The way I like to make the comparison is by comparing [a Rolls Royce][3] with [a Porsche][4]. Both are very good cars but if you gave a Rolls Royce to a petrol head they would probably sell it and buy something different. Similarly, giving Porsches to people like Lord Sugar and Hugh Heffner is likely to put their backs out.

Ubuntu has a one size fits all desktop environment called Unity as well as the best applications that Linux has to offer installed by default, including Rhythmbox and [LibreOffice][5]. Ubuntu is much like a Rolls Royce. It is built for comfort and it is built to get from A to B in the most stylish way possible.

As a Ubuntu user you are much like the passenger in a car. You can get things done whilst the journey is taking place and everything is nice and easy going.

Xubuntu on the other hand utilises the lightweight [XFCE desktop environment][6]. The applications are also lightweight in nature and whilst they get the job done they aren't as complete as the ones that are installed with Ubuntu.

The XFCE desktop environment is highly customisable making it possible to pimp your desktop to be anything you want it to be.

Xubuntu is therefore much like a custom made sports car. You make it everything you want it to be and instead of being a passenger you are very much a driver making sweeping turns and caressing your way around tight corners.

If you aren't that bothered about making your desktop prettier and customising your desktop and you find that Ubuntu does everything you want it to do then there is no need to switch to Xubuntu.

If however you find Unity to not be everything that you require or you find that your computer is lagging under the strain a little bit then Xubuntu is definitely something to consider.

I released an article last week showing how to create a Xubuntu USB drive and I also created a Xubuntu installation guide.

If you have already installed Ubuntu you do not need to follow either of those guides. Instead you just need to read on and you will be able to install a more suitable solution from within Ubuntu.

So what should you do if you have Ubuntu and you wish to switch to Xubuntu?

You have a choice to make. Is the issue that you just want the more lightweight and customisable XFCE desktop or do you want the lightweight applications that come with Xubuntu as well?

Lets deal with the applications. Here are a list of applications that come with Ubuntu and Xubuntu. If you only need a couple of the Xubuntu applications then I would recommend just installing XFCE and then installing the applications separately. If you need more than half of the applications install the entire Xubuntu desktop environment.

### How To Install The XFCE Desktop Environment Using Ubuntu ###

![Default XFCE Desktop](http://f.tqn.com/y/linux/1/W/U/J/1/xfce1.png)

The method I am going to show for installing the XFCE desktop within Ubuntu is by using the command line tool [apt-get][7].

Open a terminal window within Unity by either searching for "TERM" via [the Dash][8] or by pressing CTRL + ALT + T.

Installing the XFCE desktop is simply a case of typing the following commands:

>sudo apt-get update
>sudo apt-get install xfce4

To switch to [the XFCE desktop environment][9], click your username in the top right corner and log out.

When you reach the login screen click the little Ubuntu icon next to your username and there will now be options for the Unity desktop and the XFCE desktop. Change the desktop to XFCE and log in normally.

A message will appear asking whether you want the default panel arrangement or whether you want a single panel.

[The latest version of Xubuntu][10] has a single panel at the top but I still prefer the 2 panel setup,  a standard panel at the top and a docking panel with my favourite applications at the bottom.

Note that the menu system that comes with the XFCE desktop is different to the one that comes with Xubuntu and until you [install a better menu system][11] the 2 panel setup is probably a better choice.

It is up to you as to which option you select but rest assured it is easy to change your mind at a later point. XFCE is highly customisable.

### How To Switch From Ubuntu To Xubuntu Without Reinstalling From Scratch ###

![Switch From Ubuntu To Xubuntu.](http://f.tqn.com/y/linux/1/W/W/J/1/xfce3.png)

If you want everything that comes with Xubuntu but you don't want to go through the hassle of reinstalling from scratch follow these instructions.

Open a terminal window by searching for "TERM" in the Dash or by pressing CTRL + ALT + T.

Enter the following commands into the terminal window:

>sudo apt-get update
>sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop

This will take longer than installing just the XFCE desktop but will be quicker than reinstalling Xubuntu from scratch.

After the installation has completed click on your username in the top right corner and log out.

From the login box click on the Ubuntu symbol. There should now be options for Unity and Xubuntu. Click on Xubuntu and log in as normal.

The Xubuntu desktop will now be shown.

There will be some differences. The menu will still be the standard XFCE menu and not the Xubuntu menu. Some of the icons will not appear on the top panel. None of these things are reasons to spend the time uninstalling Ubuntu and reinstalling Xubuntu.

In the next guide I will show you how to customise Xubuntu and the XFCE desktop.
