When we talk of email clients for Linux, generally the name of [Thunderbird][1], [Geary][2] and [Evolution][3] come to our mind. To challenge the authority of these big players, a new open source email client is entering the market.

### Design plus features ###

[N1][4] is the next generation open source email client which has equal focus on design and features. An open source software, N1 is available for Linux and Mac OS X with a Windows desktop application in the pipeline.

N1 promotes itself as “extensible open source email client” because it includes a JavaScript plugin architecture that enables anyone to create powerful new features. Extensibility is a heavily popular feature that helped [open source code editor Atom][5] to gain popularity. N1 is also putting emphasis on it.

Apart from extensibility, N1 has also focused on the looks and design of the application. A look at the screenshot of N1 is a good enough example:

In other features, N1 is compatible with hundreds of email providers, including Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, Microsoft Exchange etc. Desktop app provides offline capability.

### For now, invite only ###

I don’t know why everyone is following OnePlus’ “exclusive invite only” marketing strategy? At present, N1 desktop app can be downloaded only when you are invited. You can request an invite using the link below. N1 team will email you the download link in a few days.

### Intriguing? ###

I am not a big fan of desktop email clients, but N1 has definitely caught my attention and I am willing to give it a try. How about you?
