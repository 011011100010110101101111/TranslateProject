================================================================================

In last post, we saw an [open source to-do app Go For It!][1]. In a similar article, today we’ll see an **open source note taking application Papyrus**.

[Papyrus][2] is a fork of [Kaqaz note manager][3] and is built on QT5. It brings a clean, polished user interface and is security focused (as it claims). Emphasizing on simplicity, I find Papyrus similar to OneNote. You organize your notes in ‘paper’ and add them a label for grouping those papers. Simple enough!

### Papyrus features: ###

Though Papyrus focuses on simplicity, it still has plenty of features up its sleeves. Some of the main features are:

- Note management with labels and categories
- Advanced search options
- Touch mode available
- Full screen option
- Back up to Dropbox/hard drive/external
- Password protection for selective papers
- Sharing papers with other applications
- Encrypted synchronization via Dropbox
- Available for Android, Windows and OS X apart from Linux

### Install Papyrus ###

Papyrus has APK available for Android users. There are installer files for Windows and OS X. Linux users can get source code of the application. Ubuntu and other Ubuntu based distributions can use the .deb packages. Based on your OS and preference, you can get the respective files from the Papyrus download page:
