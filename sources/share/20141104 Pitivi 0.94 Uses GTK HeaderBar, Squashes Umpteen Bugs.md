Pitivi 0.94 Uses GTK HeaderBar, Squashes Umpteen Bugs
================================================================================
**I’m a big fan of the [Pitivi video editor][1]. It might not (yet, at least) be the most whizz-bang or feature-filled non-linear editor available on Linux but it is one of the most reliable! **

So, naturally, I was expecting to see a new beta release of the open-source editor [go live at the weekend][2]. 

Pitivi 0.94 is the fourth release based on the new ‘GStreamer Editing Services’ library (GES).

Project member Jean-François Fortin Tam, also known by the handle ‘Nekohayo‘, describes the update on his blog as ”**…mainly a maintenance release, but it does pack a few interesting improvements & features in addition to the bug fixes.**”

### What’s new? ###

Interesting improvements indeed! The most noticeable change in Pitivi 0.94 is the switch to GNOME’s client-side GTK HeaderBar decoration. HeaderBars unify the window bar, title bar and toolbar into one, saving a huge amount of wasted vertical and horizontal space in the process.

“*Once you try it, you can’t go back,*” says Fortin Tam. A quick glance at the screenshot below and you’ll be nodding in agreement.

What about the app menu? No fear; the consolidation sees the introduction of an app menu button, as per the GNOME human interface guidelines.

#### Fixes, Fixes, Fixes ####

There’s also a slew of important bug fixes and stability improvements bundled up, including fixes for those running the editor outside of GNOME Shell and/or a Linux distribution shipping with a broken version of [COGL][3] (yes, even Ubuntu).

Elsewhere:

- Positioning of UI components on fresh install has been improved
- Undocked window components do not shift position on startup
- Effects can be reordered within a clip’s properties
- Title editor UI has been simplified
- Global undo/redo fix
- Timeline UI animations have been tweaked
- Editor ported to Python 3

Further details can be found in the official [release notes][4].

### Getting Better ###

All of the above reads great, right? Well, the next release should be even better. That’s not just usual developer hyperbole, as Jean-François  explains:

> “The next release (0.95) will run on top of a refined and incredibly more robust backend thanks to the work that Mathieu [Duponchelle] and Thibault [Saunier] have been doing to replace GNonLin by NLE (the new non-linear engine for GES) and fixing video mixing issues.”

Ubuntu 14.10 ships with an older (crash-prone) version in the Software Center. To try the latest release in all its glory you can grab an [all-in-one bundle][5] from the Pitivi website¹.

**Almost €20,000 has been raised as part of the Pitivi [fundraiser][6] helping it creep over the halfway point to a promised 1.0 release. If you’d like to see that arrive faster, skip a grande skinny vanilla latte at Starbucks and donate instead! **

*¹At the time of writing the bundles for 0.94 are not linked but you can grab the nightly tars instead. *
