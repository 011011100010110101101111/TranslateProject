Nathive – A libre software image editor
================================================================================
Nathive is a libre software image editor, similar to Adobe Photoshop, Corel Photo-Paint or GIMP, but focused on usability, logic and providing a smooth learning curve for everyone. The project runs in the GNOME desktop environment and anyone is welcome to collaborate on it with code, translations or ideas.

This project is in beta phase, so it is an incomplete work, unfit for the end user yet. Until now the development was focused in laying down the application core and create easy dev tools, so for now we will focus on create new plugins, because there are obvious lacks yet.

The intention is to achieve a professional image editor progressively without giving up initial usability. Nathive is written from scratch in Python using GTK+, and is designed to be simple, lightweight, and easy to install and use.

### Install Nathive on ubuntu ###
