6 Minesweeper Clones for Linux
================================================================================
### GNOME Mines ###

This is the GNOME Minesweeper clone, allowing you to choose from three different pre-defined table sizes (8×8, 16×16, 30×16) or a custom number of rows and columns. It can be ran in fullscreen mode, comes with highscores, elapsed time and hints. The game can be paused and resumed.

### ace-minesweeper ###

This is part of a package that contains some other games too, like ace-freecel, ace-solitaire or ace-spider. It has a graphical interface featuring Tux, but doesn’t seem to come with different table sizes. The package is called ace-of-penguins in Ubuntu.

### XBomb ###

XBomb is a mines game for the X Window System with three different table sizes and tiles which can take different shapes: hexagonal, rectangular (traditional) or triangular. Unfortunately the current version in Ubuntu 14.04 crashes with a segmentation fault, so you may need to install another version to make it work.
