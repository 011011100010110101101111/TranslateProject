================================================================================

Elegant, modern looking [Square icon theme][1] has recently been upgraded to version 2.0, which makes it more beautiful than ever. Square icon packs are compatible with all major desktop environments such as **Unity, GNOME, KDE, MATE** etc. Which means that you can use them for all popular Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Linux Mint, elementary OS etc. The vastness of this icon pack can be estimated from the fact it contains over 15,000 icons.

### Install and use Square icon pack 2.0 in Linux ###

There are two variants of Square icons, dark and light. Based on your preference, you can choose either of the two. For experimentation sake, I would advise you to download both variants of the icon theme.

You can download the icon pack from the link below. The files are stored in Google Drive, so don’t be suspicious if you don’t see a standard website like [SourceForge][2].

- [Square Dark Icons][3]
- [Square Light Icons][4]

To use the icon theme, extract the downloaded files in ~/.icons directory. If this doesn’t exist, create it. Once you have the files in the right place, based on your desktop environment, use a tool to change the icon theme. I have written some small tutorials in the past on this topic. Feel free to refer to them if you need further help:

- [How to change themes in GNOME Shell][6]
- [How to change themes in Linux Mint][7]
- [How to change theme in Elementary OS Freya][8]

### Give it a try ###

Here is what my Ubuntu 14.04 looks like with Square icons. I am using [Ubuntu 15.04 default wallpaper][9] in the background.

How do you find it? Do you think it can be considered as one of the [best icon themes for Ubuntu 14.04][10]? Do share your thoughts and stay tuned for more articles on customizing your Linux desktop.
