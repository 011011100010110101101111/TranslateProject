Watch These Kids Having Fun With Linux Terminal In Ubuntu
================================================================================
I found this short video of children having fun with Linux terminals in their computer lab at school. I do not know where do they belong to, but I guess it is either in Indonesia or Malaysia.

### Run train in Linux terminal ###

There is no magic here. It’s just a small command line fun tool called ‘sl’. I presume that it was developed entirely to have some fun when command ls is wrongly typed. If you ever worked on Linux terminal, you know that ls is one of the most commonly used commands and perhaps one of the most frequently mis-typed command as well.

If you want to have little fun with this terminal train, you can install it using the following command:

    sudo apt-get install sl

To run the terminal train, just type **sl** in the terminal. It also has the following options:

- -a : Accident mode. You can see people crying help
- -l : shows a smaller train but with more coaches
- -F : A flying train
- -e : Allows interrupt by Ctrl+C. In other mode you cannot use Ctrl+C to stop the train. But then, it doesn’t run for long.

Normally, you should hear the whistle as well but it doesn’t work in most of the Linux OS, Ubuntu 14.04 being one of them. Here is the accidental terminal train :)
