UbuTricks – Script to install the latest versions of several games and applications in Ubuntu
================================================================================
UbuTricks is a program that helps you install the latest versions of several games and applications in Ubuntu.

UbuTricks is a Zenity-based, graphical script with a simple interface. Although early in development, its aim is to create a simple, graphical way of installing updated applications in Ubuntu 14.04 and future releases.

Apps will be downloaded and installed automatically. Some will require a PPA to be added to the repositories. Others will be compiled from source if no PPA is available. The compilation process can take a long time, while installing from a PPA or DEB file should be quick, depending on your download speed.

### The install methods are as follows: ###

- PPA – the program will be downloaded and installed from a PPA
- DEB – the program will be installed from a DEB package
- Source – the program will be compiled (may take a long time)
- Script – the program will be installed using a script provided by the developer
