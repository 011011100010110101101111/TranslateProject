Ubuntu Countdown, third-party Ubuntu 13.10-related interesting widget
================================================================================
Two days left for the exciting arrival of Ubuntu 13.10, stable Ubuntu release marking a fresh new Ubuntu experience with new features, optimizations and under-the-hood enhancements.

**Ubuntu Countdown** is a **third-party** widget that displays in real time the amount of time left until Ubuntu 13.10's release, offering an interesting clock rendered on top of an Ubuntu-wise wallpaper.

The Ubuntu Countdown widget comes with minimalism and readability, allowing the viewer to easily observe the interval of time between the now and the October 17th's long-awaited release.

A definitely interesting aspect of the mentioned countdown is its double-sided nature: on one hand, there is the countdown, on the other hand, there is the encapsulated [ubuntu.com][1].

Meaning, clicking on the widget, changes the countdown with the official ubuntu.com website, permitting further actions on ubuntu.com, actions happening inside the same widget.
