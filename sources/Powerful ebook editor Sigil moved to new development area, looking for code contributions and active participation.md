Powerful ebook editor Sigil moved to new development area, looking for code contributions and active participation 
================================================================================

Yet, it seems that presently Sigil is traversing an unfortunate road, namely, its lack of code participation and involvement.

Today, the main Sigil maintainer [announced](http://sigildev.blogspot.ro/2013/09/sigil-status.html) that Sigil "has zero outside contributors as of now", being "on life support" due to inexistent participation to the project.

As a consequence, the developer has moved the development of Sigil on GitHub (from the now-old Google Code), hoping that the new development area,--GitHub--, will attract new interested developers willing to contribute code to the powerful ebook editor, "to help with gaining contributors I've decided to move the project to GitHub".

The new open-for-participation location is available on [https://github.com/user-none/Sigil](https://github.com/user-none/Sigil)

"That's pretty much where Sigil is a this point. I can't say where it will go in the future but my hope is more people will contribute with the move to GitHub and Sigil will continue to grow".
