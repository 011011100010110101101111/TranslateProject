” [Linux][1] is Everywhere. From Space Stations to Microwave Ovens, Linux powers everything.” You might have heard that a lot and have always wondered ” Is that just a phrase or is it actually true ? “  Be assured, it is true. World’s biggest companies use Linux in one way or another but you are not going to believe unless I take names. Well, get ready for a roller coaster ride across the globe where I show you where and how Linux is used

### Government ###

Most of the Governments use Linux, which is pretty obvious for two major reasons. It saves money and provides the flexibility no other OS can . Below is a comprehensive list of Governments around the global using Linux -:

- **America** – Starting July 2001, The White House started migrating the computers to the Linux-based [Red Hat][2] Linux and [Apache][3] HTTP Server and the migration was completed in February 2009. In October 2009, [Drupal][4] was chosen as the primary Content management system for White House Servers.

Even though more than 80% of workstations were already using Free Software like Open Office, Firefox and Thunderbird.In November 2008, five years later the migration rate of 20% was achieved because of focusing on smaller deployments and winning over staff to the value of program. By the end of 2011, more than 9000 desktops were running Linux and the government of Munich later reported that the migration to Linux was highly successful and has already saved the city over €11 million ( USD $14 million ).
