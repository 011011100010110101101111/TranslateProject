Contacts App updated with enhanced avatar support 翻译中 FineFan
================================================================================
The fresh new next-generation applications of the next-generation Ubuntu are being gradually erected and solidified via a multiple-sided approach, including a set of core applications created by third-party developers mixed with Ubuntu coders and Ubuntu designers, as well as more official applications created by Ubuntu developers and Ubuntu designers.

As part of the latter, there is Contacts App, too, handy useful application gathering contact-management capabilities into a beautiful interface, where multiple editable fields, fast scroll-through and listed items provide an interesting contact-related application (work in progress).

[Contacts App][1] has been updated to another feature-adding release, pushing forward its [recently-introduced][2] functionalities, namely, the avatar support for contacts.

In its previous releases, Contacts App introduced support for avatars selected by the user via Content Hub, feature enriched now with image-display support on the **main view**.

Meaning, clicking on a contact, hitting the bottom-bar's `Edit` button and adding an image (the actual avatar) via the monochrome icon, adds the image after the `Save` button is clicked; navigating now to the main view, the user is to notice the previously-added avatar on the main view, replacing the monochrome generic icon with the added image.

Moreover, the avatar is rendered with round corners beautifying the contacts, round thumbnails generated even if the user selects,--as avatar--, a regular non-square image.

Furthermore, clicking on the avatar-enabled contact, opens the contact, where the user is to observe the retained image, replacing the now-old generic preview image.

Contacts App is [available][3] for installation/testing via Ubuntu 13.10's Ubuntu Software Center.
