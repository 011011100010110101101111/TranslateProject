Feeling creative? There are a multitude of applications available for Fedora to aid your creativity. From digital painting, vectors, to pixel art there is something for everyone to get creative this weekend. This article highlights a selection of the applications available for Fedora for creating awesome images.

### Vector graphics: Inkscape

[Inkscape][1] is a well known and loved Open Source vector graphics editor. SVG is the primary file format of Inkscape, so all your drawings will scale no-problems! Inkscape has been around for many years, so there is a solid community and [mountains of tutorials and other resources][2] for getting started.

Being a vector graphics editor, Inkscape is better suited towards simpler illustrations (for example a simple comics style). However, using vector blurs, some artists create some [amazing vector drawings][3].

Additionally, Krita is an active project, with a vibrant community — so [lots of tutorials to get started][6]. Krita features multiple brush engines, a UI with pop-up palletes, a wrap-around mode for creating seamless patterns, filters, layers, and much more.
