tmate -- Instantly Share Your Terminal Session To Anyone In Seconds 
=================

A while ago, we wrote about
[teleconsole](https://www.2daygeek.com/teleconsole-share-terminal-session-instantly-to-anyone-in-seconds/)
which is used to share terminal instantly to anyone (whoever you trusting). Today also we are going to discuss about same kind of
application called tmate.

Why you want tmate application? this will help you to get help from your
friends when you need.

### What Is tmate?

[tmate](https://tmate.io/) stands for teammates, it's a fork of tmux,
and uses the same configurations such as keybindings, color schemes etc.
It's a terminal multiplexer with instant terminal sharing. it enables a
number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a
single screen, that can be shared with another mates.

You can detach the session by leaving the job running in background and
re-attach the session when you want to view the status. tmate provides
an instant pairing solution, allowing you to share a terminal with one
or several teammates.

A status line at the bottom of the screen shows information on the
current session, such as ssh command to share with your mate.

### How tmate works?

-   When launching tmate, an ssh connection is established to tmate.io
    (backend servers maintained by tmate developers) in the background
    through libssh.
-   The server (tmate.io) ssh key signatures are verified during the DH
    exchange.
-   The client is authenticated with local ssh keys.
-   Once connection is established, a 150 bits (non guessable random
    characters) session token is generated by local tmux server.
-   teammates can connect to tmate.io using the SSH session ID provided
    by user

### Prerequisites for tmate

Generate SSH key as a prerequisites since tmate.io server authenticate
client machine through local ssh keys. Make a note, every system should
have SSH key.
```shell
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/magi/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/magi/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/magi/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:3ima5FuwKbWyyyNrlR/DeBucoyRfdOtlUmb5D214NC8 [email protected]
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|                 |
|           .     |
|      . . =   o  |
|     *ooS= . + o |
|  . [email protected]*o.o.+ E .|
|   =o==B++o  = . |
|  o.+*o+..    .  |
| ..o+o=.         |
