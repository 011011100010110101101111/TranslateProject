YOU CAN TRY A DEMO UBUNTU VERSION IN A WEB BROWSER
=====================================================

Canonical, the parent company of Ubuntu, has put a lot of effort in popularizing Linux. No matter how much you dislike Ubuntu, but you have to accept that it has actually helped to make “Linux for human beings”. Ubuntu and its derivatives are the most used Linux distributions.

In an effort to further popularize Ubuntu Linux, Canonical has put a website in place where you can use a [demo version of Ubuntu][1]. It will help you get the look and feel of Ubuntu. With that, it will be a little easier to make a decision about using Ubuntu for new users.

You may argue that a live USB of Ubuntu will be better as it provides a far better experience without installing. I agree to that but keep in mind the effort to download the ISO, to create a live USB, change boot configuration and then using the live USB to experience. It’s tedious and not everyone is going to do that. An online tour is a simpler way out.

So, what do you see in this online Ubuntu demo tour. Not a lot actually.

You can browse files, you can use Unity Dash, you can experience Ubuntu Software Center, even install a few apps (they won’t be really installed), browse the File Manager and other such things. But that’s all. But in my opinion, it’s pretty nifty and does what it intends to do and that is provide a quick look at this popular OS.
