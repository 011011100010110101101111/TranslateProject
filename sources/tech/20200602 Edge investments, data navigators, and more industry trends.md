Edge investments, data navigators, and more industry trends
======
A weekly look at open source community and industry trends.
![Person standing in front of a giant computer screen with numbers, data][1]

As part of my role as a senior product marketing manager at an enterprise software company with an open source development model, I publish a regular update about open source community, market, and industry trends for product marketers, managers, and other influencers. Here are five of my and their favorite articles from that update.

## [Call to Participate: 1H 2020 CNCF Cloud Native Survey][2]

> The information gathered from the survey is used by CNCF to better understand the current cloud native ecosystem. It can be used by the community as a data point to consider as they develop their cloud native strategies. Help out CNCF and the community by filling out the [survey][3]! The results will be open sourced and shared on [GitHub][4] as well as a report in the June time frame. To see last year’s results, read the [2019 survey report][5].

**The impact**: The CNCF has a lot going on; help them prioritize your priorities.

## [Where are edge computing investments going?][6]

> We are seeing five main pools of capital flowing into edge computing:
>
>   1. Earlier stage and higher risk – VCs and private equity (PE);
>   2. Later stage and lower risk infrastructure funds;
>   3. Public cloud providers looking to exploit the assets of telecoms operators (and others);
>   4. Tech companies carving out a role in edge computing as a new opportunity or to support their existing business;
>   5. Telecoms operators themselves looking to build positions beyond basic infrastructure.
>


**The impact**: It is still early days in edge computing; early enough to get your wildly impraticle open source edge startup funded from one of these pools.

## [The New Stack Context: Is Kubernetes the New App Server?][7]

> Most enterprise OpenStack vendors focused on sort of a public cloud competition path, if you will. However, I think because of that deeply rooted in infrastructure focus, most of those vendors didn’t acknowledge the value of the platform services that the public cloud offered,” She said. “There’s something I heard once, where everybody thinks that their layer in the stack is where the hard problems are. That every layer above them is easy. If you’re deeply entrenched in infrastructure thinking, you don’t appreciate the ways in which that ecosystem is developing above you.

**The impact**: That right there is why there is so much talk about the importance of empathy in software product development.

## [Happy Developers: Navigators of the data age][8]

> Data is not the new gold or oil, it’s the new oxygen. Every part of the modern business needs it, ranging from sales to marketing to product, all the way through security, data-science, and of course to engineering itself. However, the pursuit and effort to obtain data is not about blindly collecting, as opposed to what some vendors of big-data solutions might be claiming. Data is about quality before quantity. Each voyage is about getting to the right data at the right time and how to derive the right products from it. You don’t want to drown in data, you want to swim in it. As historian Yuval Noah Harari put it in his bestselling book [Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow][9]: “In ancient times having power meant having access to data. Today having power means knowing what to ignore.”

**The impact**: In the short term this is true, but only as far as it enables surviving in the longer term to the point where the blindly collected mass data becomes retroactively scrutable. Collect it all, ignore what you don't need right now, and return to the rest later when you know more and have more resources.

_I hope you enjoyed this list and come back next week for more open source community, market, and industry trends._
