The application is designed to run on all major platforms including **Mac**, **Windows** and **Linux**. For the point of Linux, it is important to mention that the application is designed for **x86** processor only. However installing an **x86** application on **x86_64** architecture is possible. We have to tweak a little to make it work **x86_64** systems.

#### An insight of the Technical Specification on different Platforms ####

**Important**: As visible in the above specification, some of the features like detailed specification are not available on platform other than Linux, for free. It is just to support Server and Bandwidth cost. For a Linux user, nothing needs to be cared about as far as detailed statistics are concerned, a proud moment.

### Installing iCup 2014 Brazil in Linux ###

First go to official [iCup 2014 Brazil download][1] page and download application according to your platform and architecture.

#### On 32-Bit System ####

    # cd Downloads/
    # tar xvf iCup_2014_FREE-Brazil_1.1_linux.tar.bz2 
    # cd iCup\ 2014\ FREE\ -\ Brazil\ 1.1/
    # chmod 755 iCup\ 2014\ FREE\ -\ Brazil

As I said above, this application is designed for x86 systems only. In order to Install a 32 bit application on 64 bit architecture, we need to prepare our system by installing some packages – **GTK+2** and **libstdc++.so.6**.

Well not for this Application only, but there are a whole lot of application in Linux which is not supported in 64-bit e.g., **Skype**. We need to build our System to install those applications.

#### On 64-Bit Systems ####

Install **GTK+2** and **libstdc++so.6**, using apt or yum command as shown below.

    $ sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0 libstdc++6 		[on Debian based systems]

If you get any dependency error, run the following command to resolve those dependencies

    $ sudo apt-get -f install

----------

    # yum install gtk2 libstdc++				[on RedHat based systems]

Once all the required packages are installed. Now the System is capable of running 32 bit applications on 64-bit systems, now go the directory where you’ve downloaded ‘**iCup 2014 Brazil**‘ package and run the following commands to install it.

    # cd Downloads/
    # tar xvf iCup_2014_FREE-Brazil_1.1_linux.tar.bz2 
    # cd iCup\ 2014\ FREE\ -\ Brazil\ 1.1/
    # chmod 755 iCup\ 2014\ FREE\ -\ Brazil

Next, move to the directory and double click the executable to start the application. In the below screen-shot you may not get the full information since the FIFA 2014 has not started till now. Although the glimpse of what we can get once the event starts.
