Ubuntu Kylin: The Official Chinese Version of Ubuntu
======

[_**Ubuntu has several official flavors**_][1] _**and Kylin is one of them. In this article, you’ll learn about Ubuntu Kylin, what it is, why it was created and what features it offers.**_

Kylin was originally developed in 2001 by academicians at the [National University of Defense Technology][2] in the People’s Republic of China. The name is derived from [Qilin][3], a beast from Chinese mythology.

The first versions of Kylin were based on [FreeBSD][4] and were intended for use by the Chinese military and other government organizations. Kylin 3.0 was purely based on the Linux kernel, and a version called [NeoKylin][5] which was announced in December 2010.

In 2013, [Canonical][6] (parent company of Ubuntu) reached an agreement with the [Ministry of Industry and Information Technology][7] of the People’s Republic of China to co-create and release an Ubuntu-based OS with features targeted at the Chinese market.

### What is Ubuntu Kylin?

Following the 2013 agreement mentioned above, Ubuntu Kylin is now the official Chinese version of Ubuntu. It is much more than just language localisation. In fact, it is determined to serve the Chinese market the same way as Ubuntu serves the global market.

The first version of [Ubuntu Kylin][9] came with Ubuntu 13.04. Like Ubuntu, Kylin too has LTS (long term support) and non-LTS versions.

Currently, Ubuntu Kylin 19.04 LTS implements the [UKUI][10] desktop environment with revised boot up animation, log-in/screen-lock program and OS theme. To offer a more friendly experience for users, it has fixed bugs, has a file preview function, timer log out, the latest [WPS office suite][11] and [Sogou][12] put-in methods integrated within.

Kylin 4.0.2 is a community edition based on Ubuntu Kylin 16.04 LTS. It includes several third-party applications with long term and stable support. It’s perfect for both server and desktop usage for daily office work and welcomed by the developers to [download][13]. The Kylin forums are actively available to provide feedback and also troubleshooting to find solutions.

![Kylin Software Center][17]

Kylin has a software center similar to Ubuntu software center and is called Ubuntu Kylin Software Center. It’s part of the Ubuntu Kylin Software Store that also includes Ubuntu Kylin Developer Platform and Ubuntu Kylin Repository with a simple interface and powerful function. It supports both Ubuntu and Ubuntu Kylin Repositories and is especially convenient for quick installation of Chinese characteristic software developed by Ubuntu Kylin team!

#### Youker: A series of tools

Ubuntu Kylin has also a series of tools named as Youker. Typing in “Youker” in the Kylin start menu will bring up the Kylin assistant. If you press the “Windows” key on the keyboard, you’d get a response exactly like you would on Windows. It will fire-up the Kylin start menu.

Other Kylin branded applications include Kylin Video (player), Kylin Burner, Youker Weather and Youker Fcitx which supports better office work and personal entertainment.

#### Special focus on Chinese characters

In cooperation with Kingsoft, Ubuntu Kylin developers also work on Sogou Pinyin for Linux, Kuaipan for Linux and Kingsoft WPS for Ubuntu Kylin, and also address issues with smart pinyin, cloud storage service and office applications. [Pinyin][20] is romanization system for Chinese characters. With this, user inputs with English keyboard but Chinese characters are displayed on the screen.
