Use SearchMonkey To Search Text In All Files Within A Directory In Ubuntu
================================================================================
At times we need to search files which contain some particular text or words in them. This often happens if you are a developer or programmer. Now, one can always use [Linux commands to find all files containing specific text][1], but not everyone is command line fan. I have seen excellent programmers that rely on GUI tool than command line.

If you too prefer GUI tools, than [SearchMonkey][2] is one perfect application for you.

### SearchMonkey is your desktop search engine ###

SearchMonkey searches the directories recursively so that you can sit and relax while SearchMonkey does his work. Users can search for file names and contents using powerful regular expressions. This enables SearchMonkey to be much more precise when it returns hits.

In addition, SearchMonkey doesn’t just show you a list of files that might contain what you are looking for, it helpfully displays the content with the matches highlighted.

### Install SearchMonkey in Ubuntu 14.04 ###

SearchMonkey is available in Ubuntu 14.04 (and earlier versions as well) repository. You can install it via Ubuntu Software Center or by just typing the following command in terminal:

    sudo apt-get install searchmonkey

Once installed, you can launch SearchMonkey from Unity Dash. The interface is easy to understand and easy to use.

SearchMonkey finds the files you need quickly, and without building a drive map first. Each search takes place in real time, and results are displayed in context as soon as they are found! And above all it’s a free and open source software.
