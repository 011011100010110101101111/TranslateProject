![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uMOdpnxBV9w/V5x4YW54SbI/AAAAAAAAo_E/o-gUmO46UB0Ji2IMzd_xdY5pVsCcJnFwQCLcB/s1600/free-best-password-manager-2016.png)

当涉及到维护你的网络安全,从各种网络威胁的角度来看，安装防病毒软件或运行一个[安全的Linux操作系统][1],并不意味你就是安全的。

今天大多数网络用户都容易收到网络攻击，并不是因为他们使用任何最好的防病毒软件或其他安全措施，而是因为他们使用[弱密码][2]来保护他们自己的网上帐号。

密码是你抵御网络威胁的最后一道防线。只要回顾一下最近的一些数据泄露和网络攻击，包括高调的数据泄露在[OPM数据 ][ 3 ]（美国人事管理办公室）和婚外情网站[ Ashley Madison ]的[ 4 ]，导致成千上万的记录的网上曝光。

虽然你不能控制数据泄露，但它仍然是重要的，创建强大的密码，可以抵御字典和[暴力破解][ 5 ]。

你看，你的密码越长，它越难破解。

### 如何保证在线服务的安全？

安全研究人员一直建议在线用户为他们的各种网上账户创建长的，复杂和不同的密码。因此，如果一个网站被攻破，你的其他网站上的其他帐户是安全的，不会被黑客攻击。

理想的情况下，你的密码必须至少16个字符长，应该包含数字、符号、大写字母和小写字母，最重要的是最安全的密码是一个你甚至不知道的。

密码应该不会重复而且不包含任何字典的单词，代词，你的用户名或身份证，和任何其他预定义的字母或数字序列。

我知道记住这样的复杂的密码字符串是一个真正痛苦的过程，除非我们是人类的超级计算机，为不同的在线账户记住不同的密码不是一个容易的任务。

问题是，今天人们订阅了大量的在线网站和服务，它为每一个帐户创建和记住不同的密码通常很难的。

But, Luckily to make this whole process easy, there's a growing market for password managers for PCs and phones that can significantly reduce your password memorizing problem, along with the cure for your bad habit of setting weak passwords.

### 密码管理器是什么？

![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LY7pI45tMq0/V5r_XV083RI/AAAAAAAAo6M/MivILg0_4Vs7UgLKZJqM5vhvYujQCCcpgCLcB/s1600/best-password-manager-software.png)

在过去的几年里，密码管理软件已经走了很长的路，它是一个很好的系统，都可以让你为不同的网站创建复杂的密码，并记住他们。

密码管理器是一个创建，存储和组织你的电脑，网站，应用程序和网络的所有密码的软件。

密码管理器也可在市场上生成密码和作为表单填充，它可以自动在网站的登录表单中输入您的用户名和密码。

所以，如果你想为你的多个在线帐户的超级安全的密码，但你不想记住他们所有，密码管理器是你最好的选择。

### 密码管理器如何工作？

Typically, Password Manager software works by generating long, complex, and, most importantly, unique password strings for you, and then stores them in encrypted form to protect the confidential data from hackers with physical access to your PC or mobile device.

加密的文件只能通过主密码访问。因此，所有你需要做的是记住只有一个主密码来打开你的密码管理器和解锁所有你的其他密码。

?

然而，你需要确保你的主密码是至少16个字符的额外的安全性。

### 哪个是最好的密码管理器？如何选择？

我一直推荐的密码管理器，但大多数读者总是问

- 哪个密码管理器最好？
- 哪个密码管理器最安全？帮帮我！

所以，今天我要介绍给你一些最好的密码管理器，目前可在Windows，Mac，Linux，Android、iOS和企业中使用。

在为你的设备选择一个好的密码管理器之前，你应该检查以下功能：

- 跨平台应用
- 零知识模型
- 提供双因素认证（多因素身份验证）

注意：一旦通过，开始依赖于您的密码管理器，因为如果你仍然使用弱密码为您的重要的在线帐户，没有人可以拯救你从恶意黑客。

### Best Enterprise Password Manager

Over the course of last 12 months, we've seen some of the biggest data breaches in the history of the Internet and year-over-year the growth is heating up.

According to statistics, a majority of employees even don't know how to protect themselves online, which led company’s business at risk.

To keep password sharing mechanism secure in an organization, there exist some password management tools specially designed for enterprises use, such as Vaultier, CommonKey, Meldium, PassWork, and Zoho Vault.

- 1. Meldium Enterprise Password Manager Software

![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3rKr3KUpuiQ/V5xs8JR7pVI/AAAAAAAAo-c/VF1tmKbwPzoJmNvA3Ym69CizG7_VqM6ywCLcB/s1600/Meldium-Enterprise-Password-Manager.png)

It automatically logs users into apps and websites without typing usernames and passwords and also tracks password usage within your organization.

Meldium password manager is perfect for sharing accounts within your team member without sharing the actual password, which helps organizations to protect themselves from phishing attacks.

- 1. Zoho Vault Password Management Software

![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-J-N_1wOYxmI/V5xtrz42QWI/AAAAAAAAo-o/QF4n4QAF7ZMBd7uIRdjM6Hdd1MHwsXWQACLcB/s1600/zoho-vault--Enterprise-Password-Manager.png)

### For Extra Security, Use 2-Factor Authentication

![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jDnJBDoibtQ/V5xuHVHukRI/AAAAAAAAo-w/1Erjgk-IvKs__TXwYDz-8Groz9hWEElZgCLcB/s1600/two-factor-authentication-password-security.png)

No matter how strong your password is, there still remains a possibility for hackers to find some or the other way to hack into your account.

Two-factor authentication is designed to fight this issue. Instead of just one password, it requires you to enter the second passcode which is sent either to your mobile number via an SMS or to your email address via an email.

So, I recommend you to enable two-factor authentication now along with using a password manager software to secure your online accounts and sensitive information from hackers.
