### Changes in Password Best Practices

NIST recently published its four-volume  [_SP800-63b Digital Identity Guidelines_][3] . Among other things, it makes three important suggestions when it comes to passwords:

1.  Stop it with the annoying password complexity rules. They make passwords harder to remember. They increase errors because artificially complex passwords are harder to type in. And they [don't help][1] that much. It's better to allow people to use pass phrases.

2.  Stop it with password expiration. That was an [old idea for an old way][2] we used computers. Today, don't make people change their passwords unless there's indication of compromise.

3.  Let people use password managers. This is how we deal with all the passwords we need.

These password rules were failed attempts to [fix the user][4]. Better we fix the security systems.
