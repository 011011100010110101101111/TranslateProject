Looking for Some Good Note Taking Apps on Linux? Here are the Best Notes Apps we Found for You
======

No matter what you do — taking notes is always a good habit. Yes, there are a lot of note taking apps to help you achieve that. But, what about some open-source note taking apps for Linux?

Fret not, you don’t need to endlessly search the Internet to find the best note taking app for Linux. Here, I’ve picked some of the most impressive open-source note taking apps available.

### Best Note Taking Apps for Linux

![][1]

Do note that this list is in no particular order of ranking.

#### 1\. Joplin

![][2]

**Key Features:**

  * Markdown support
  * Support for attachments
  * Encryption support
  * Cross-platform including Android app



Joplin is an impressive free open-source note taking app that supports encryption. With the features offered, it’s also one of the [best Evernote alternatives][3] out there. In fact, I moved from Evernote to Joplin just because of the features offered.

You can choose to add to-do lists, plain notes, or use it as a markdown editor to write something. It’s available for Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. You can also choose to sync your notes using [Dropbox][4], OneDrive, [NextCloud][5] or WebDAV.

If you’re curious, you can read our detailed article on [Joplin][6] to know more about it.

##### How to install it?

You get an AppImage file to install Joplin. I’ve tried it on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and it works as expected. To look for the file, you can head to its official website or explore their [GitHub page][7].

In case you don’t know how to install it, follow our guide on [using AppImage files][8] to get started.

In either case, if you want to use the terminal, you can type the command below to install it through a script (which also adds a desktop icon in the process):

```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/master/Joplin_install_and_update.sh | bash
```

#### 2\. Simplenote

![][10]

**Key Features:**

  * Markdown support
  * Simple user interface
  * Easily sync using your Simplenote account
  * 32-bit package available
  * Cross-platform including mobile apps



As the name suggests, it is a simple free and open-source note taking app.

Developed by [Automattic][11] (the company behind WordPress), Simplenote lets you seamlessly sync your notes across multiple devices. It supports Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and macOS as well.

Unlike some others, you will notice that the interface is dead simple and may not offer a bunch of features. However, you get the ability to add tags to your notes.

##### How to install it?

It offers **.deb / .rpm** packages along with an AppImage file. You can find the files in its [GitHub releases section][12].

#### 3\. Laverna

**Note:** _This isn’t actively developed anymore — but it still works as expected._

![][14]

**Key Features:**

  * Markdown support
  * Encryption support
  * Sync support



Laverna is an interesting open-source note taking application that also offers encryption (which is optional).

You can use it as a web-based note taking app or as something on your computer. It’s available for Linux, Mac, and Windows as well.

While it features all the basic functionalities for a note taking app in addition to the encryption support, you don’t get a mobile app to use. So, this is something that you can use only if you’re a desktop user and get most of the things done on a web browser.

##### How to install it?

It provides a zip file which is available on its [official website][15]. Once you download it, you need to extract it and launch the executable file to get started.

#### 4\. Standard Notes

![][16]

**Key Features:**

  * Markdown support
  * Encryption support
  * Sync support
  * Version history of notes (paid plan)
  * Cross-platform including mobile apps
  * 32-bit package offered
  * Offers premium options



Yet another open-source note taking app that offers encryption for your notes and attachments.

Unlike Laverna, Standard Notes is being actively developed. While it offers a great deal of features, some of them are limited to paid subscribers as “extended features” or extensions which is on the expensive side (for monthly subscription). You can also refer to our separate article on [Standard Notes][17] to learn more about it.

Overall, you get the markdown support, ability to encrypt attachments and notes, version history, backup support (to OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.) and more such useful features.

##### How to install it?

It offers an AppImage file to install it on your Linux distro. You just need to head to its [official website][18] to download it. In case you don’t know how to use the file, refer to our [AppImage guide][8].

For other available packages or source, you can refer to their [GitHub page][19].

[Standard Notes][18]

#### 5\. Boost Note

![][20]

**Key Features:**

  * Markdown support
  * Suitable for developers as well
  * Cross-platform



[Boost Note][21] is a useful note taking app for programmers using Linux. You can write your codes and also use it to write notes, documentations, and much more.

It offers a clean and intuitive user interface and offers all the basic features for a note taking app on Linux.

#### How to install it?

You can opt for the **.deb** file available for Ubuntu on its [official website][22]. If you want to try it on other Linux distributions, you will also find an AppImage file to get started.

If you’re curious, you can also check out their [GitHub page][23] to explore more about it or fork it.

#### 6\. Tomboy Notes (Next Generation)

![][24]

**Key Features:**

  * Lightweight note taking app
  * Sync support
  * Cross-platform



How about a lightweight and dead simple note-taking app?

Well, you might be aware of the old [Tomboy note taking app][25] which is no longer developed. Fortunately, there’s a next-generation version of the Tomboy notes. You can configure the path to store notes and get started taking notes quickly.

The app is merely ~2 MB to download. So, if you were looking for a lightweight solution — this is it. It may not be available for smartphones — but you can surely use it on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

#### How to install it?

You can find .**deb / .rpm** and other packages in their [GitHub releases section][26]. For other Linux distros, you can follow documentations in their GitHub page to know more about it.

[Tomboy Notes NG][27]

#### 7\. RedNoteBook

![][28]

Key Features:

  * Traditional Journal-style note taking app
  * Templates available
  * Offline-use



RedNoteBook should be a good choice for users who wanted an offline note taking app on Linux.

Yes, it does not support synchronization and if you’re someone who doesn’t want the sync feature, RedNoteBook should be a traditional-style note taking app with a sidebar for calendar.

It’s mostly tailored for users who like to have an offline journal. It also provides a couple of templates for you to make it easy creating certain notes.

##### How to install it?

If you’re using Ubuntu (or any other Ubuntu-based distro), you can install it via PPA. Here’s what you have to type in your terminal to install it:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rednotebook/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rednotebook
```

For all other Linux distributions, you can get the [Flatpak package][29].

[RedNotebook][30]

#### 8\. TagSpaces

![][31]

**Key Features:**

  * Rich user interface
  * Supports managing documents
  * Sync support
  * Offers premium options



TagSpaces is a beautiful note taking app available for Linux. Not just limited to creating notes, but you can manage photos and other documents as well.

Unlike some other note taking apps available, it doesn’t offer encryption. So, you can try tools like [Syncthing to sync your data][32] safely along with the support Dropbox and Nextcloud.

You can also opt for its premium plans if you want special features and support.

##### How to install it?

You can find the .**deb** file and an AppImage file in their [GitHub releases section][33] to install it. In either case, you can build it as well.

[TagSpaces][34]

#### 9\. Trilium Notes

![][35]

**Key Features:**

  * Hierarchical note taking app
  * Encryption supported
  * Sync support



Trilium Notes is not just another note taking app, it’s a hierarchical note taking application with focus on building personal knowledge bases.

Yes, you can use it for common use as well — but it’s tailored for specific users who want the ability to manage the notes in a hierarchical fashion.

I haven’t used this personally — except for testing it. Feel free to try it out and explore more.

#### How to install it?

Simply head to its [GitHub releases section][36] and grab the [.**deb** file to install it on Ubuntu][37]. If you’re looking for other Linux distros, you can build it from source or download and [extract the zip file][38] as well.

### Wrapping Up

That concludes my recommendation for note taking apps on Linux. I have used plenty of them and currently settled for Simplenote for quick notes and Joplin for collection of notes in chapters.
