Command line secrets
================================================================================
There are loads of really good reasons to use the command line. It’s the most powerful and concise method of interacting with your computer, as we show in [issue 3 of Linux Voice][1]. However, we decided to take a moment to look at some of its more obscure (and some would say pointless) uses.

### Browsing the web ###

Firefox and Chromium are both great browsers, but have you ever thought they’re a little too graphical? No? Well take a look at the video below where we take the elinks web browser out for a spin around hacker news. It might not be as colourful as its more famous rivals, but it manages to render most web pages.

As well has having geek-chic, it can come in handy when you just need to quickly check if a web page is accessible from a computer you only have SSH access to.

### Looking up definitions on Wikipedia ###

Yes, we’ve already covered using the web, but the web isn’t the only way of accessing information on Wikipedia. David Leadbeater has set up a DNS server that holds extracts from Wikipedia in DNS entries. This lets you grab information using command line tools such as dig.

### Watch movies ###

Who needs Netflix or YouTube when you can watch Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope directly in your terminal by telneting into towel.blinkenlights.nl

### Play games ###

There were plenty of games for Linux before Steam came along, and many of them didn’t need any fancy graphics. NetHack, Robots and Greed are just a few examples. Here’s a peek at Moon Buggy.
