The Easy Way to Keep Track of Multiple Time Zones in Ubuntu
================================================================================

**Whether I’m making sure that a tweet about a Chromebook sale in Australia hits those down under when awake or scheduling a Skype call with *Sam Tran*, the ‘developer’ half of Ohso, I work with multiple time zones in mind.**

And therein lies a problem. If you know me you’ll  know that I have the memory capacity of a goldfish running Windows Vista (i.e., not very good). I can barely recall what I got up to yesterday, much less remember the time differential between my door and the foot of Golden Gate bridge!

To help, I use widgets and menu items to keep me in sync. I move across multiple operating systems in the space of a regular working day, mobile and desktop, but only one lets me set up ‘world clocks’ the quickest and easiest.

**And it happens to be the one whose name is above the door.**

### Add World Clocks to Ubuntu Date/Time Applet ###

The default date-time indicator in Unity comes with supports for adding and viewing multiple time zones. No add-ons, no extra packages required.

1. Click on the clock applet and select the ‘**Time & Date Settings**’  entry
1. In the ‘**Clock**’ tab, check the box next to ‘**Time in Other Locations**’
1. Click the ‘**Choose Locations**‘ button
1. Tap ‘**+**’  and enter the name of the location

#### Other Desktop Environments ####

The default clock applet in **KDE Plasma** has a similar feature and flow:

1. Right-click on the digital clock widget and select ‘**Digital Clock Settings**’
1. Click the ‘**Time Zones**’ section
1. Enter the name of a city in the search field
1. Click ‘**Ok**’

The extensible nature of **GNOME Shell** sees a slew of World Clock options available to fill the gap left by its default time ticker, with ‘[multi clock][1]’ being my personal favourite. The same goes again for **Cinnamon**, whose ‘panel applet’ repository has ample choices, like the super slick “**World Clock Calendar**” .

**XFCE** and **LXDE** aren’t quite as generous, with the only out-of-the-box “workarounds” being **multiple clocks** added to the panel, each manually configured to a given locale. Both do support ‘indicator applets’, so if you’re not dependent on Unity you can install/add the standalone date/time indicator.

**Budgie** is a little too young to make corner case demands of, while Pantheon I haven’t tried — I’ll let you fill me in on that score in the comments.

#### Desktop Apps, Widgets & Conky Themes ####

Of course, panel applets are just one way to keep tabs of the time in other countries’ multiple time zones. If you’re not fussed about panel access there are various **desktop apps** available, many of which work cross-distro and/or cross-platform.

**GNOME Clocks** is one such app and is available to install straight from the Ubuntu Software Center in 14.04 LTS+. **Conky** is a potential alternative (though I haven’t yet found a pre-made theme designed for the purpose) and lightweight Chrome Apps like [Calendar Clock][2] will work anywhere Chrome does, free of the browser.

**Do you keep tabs on time zones? If so, what app, method or widget do you use to stay on top? **
