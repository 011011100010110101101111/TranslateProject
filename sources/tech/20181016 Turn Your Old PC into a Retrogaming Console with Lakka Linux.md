Turn Your Old PC into a Retrogaming Console with Lakka Linux
======
**If you have an old computer gathering dust, you can turn it into a PlayStation like retrogaming console with Lakka Linux distribution. **

You probably already know that there are [Linux distributions specially crafted for reviving older computers][1]. But did you know about a Linux distribution that is created for the sole purpose of turning your old computer into a retro-gaming console?

![Lakka is a Linux distribution specially for retrogaming][2]

Meet [Lakka][3], a lightweight Linux distribution that will transform your old or low-end computer (like Raspberry Pi) into a complete retrogaming console,

When I say retrogaming console, I am serious about the console part. If you have ever used a PlayStation of Xbox, you know what a typical console interface looks like.

Lakka provides a similar interface and a similar experience. I’ll talk about the ‘experience’ later. Have a look at the interface first.

### Lakka: Linux distributions for retrogaming

Lakka is the official Linux distribution of [RetroArch][4] and the [Libretro][5] ecosystem.

RetroArch is a frontend for retro game emulators and game engines. The interface you saw in the video above is nothing but RetroArch. If you just want to play retro games, you can simply install RetroArch in your current Linux distribution.

Lakka provides Libretro core with RetroArch. So you get a preconfigured operating system that you can install or plug in the live USB and start playing games.

Lakka is lightweight and you can install it on most old systems or single board computers like Raspberry Pi.

It supports a huge number of emulators. You just need to download the ROMs on your system and Lakka will play the games from these ROMs. You can find the list supported emulators and hardware [here][6].

It enables you to run classic games on a wide range of computers and consoles through its slick graphical interface. Settings are also unified so configuration is done once and for all.

Let me summarize the main features of Lakka:

  * PlayStation like interface with RetroArch
  * Support for a number of retro game emulators
  * Supports up to 5 players gaming on the same system
  * Savestates allow you to save your progress at any moment in the game
  * You can improve the look of your old games with various graphical filters
  * You can join multiplayer games over the network
  * Out of the box support for a number of joypads like XBOX360, Dualshock 3, and 8bitdo
  * Unlike trophies and badges by connecting to [RetroAchievements][7]



### Getting Lakka

Before you go on installing Lakka you should know that it is still under development so expect a few bugs here and there.

Keep in mind that Lakka only supports MBR partitioning. So if it doesn’t read your hard drive while installing, this could be a reason.

The [FAQ section of the project][8] answers the common doubts, so please refer to it for any further questions.
