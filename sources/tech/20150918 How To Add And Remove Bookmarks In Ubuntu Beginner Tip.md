In this quick tip for absolute beginners, I am going to show you how to add bookmarks in Ubuntu File manager, Files.

Now, if you wonder why would you do that, the answer is pretty simple. It gives you quick access, right in the left sidebar. For example, I [installed Copy in Ubuntu][1]. Now it has been created in /Home/Copy. Not a big deal to go in Home and then go in Copy directory, but I would like to access it rather quickly. So, I add a bookmark to it so that I would be able to access it from the sidebar.

### Add a bookmark in Ubuntu ###

Open Files. Go to the location which you want to save for quick access. You need to be inside the directory to bookmark it.

Now, you have two ways to do it.

#### Option 1: ####

When you are in Files (file explorer in Ubuntu), look at the top for the global menu. You would see Bookmarks. Click on it and you’ll see the option to add the current location as boomark.

#### Option 2: ####

You can simply press Ctrl+D and the current location will be added as a bookmark.

As you can see, here is the newly added Copy directory in the left sidebar for quick access:

### Manage Bookmarks ###

If you think you have got too many bookmarks or if you added a bookmark by mistake, you can remove a bookmark easily. Press Ctrl+B to access all the bookmarks. Here, select the desired bookmark and click on – to delete it.

That’s all you need to do to manage bookmarks in Ubuntu. I know it might be trivial with most of the users, but it might help people who are absolutely new to Ubuntu.
