15 open source applications for MacOS

I use open source tools whenever and wherever I can. I returned to college a while ago to earn a master's degree in educational leadership. Even though I switched from my favorite Linux laptop to a MacBook Pro (since I wasn't sure Linux would be accepted on campus), I decided I would keep using my favorite tools, even on MacOS, as much as I could.

Fortunately, it was easy, and no professor ever questioned what software I used. Even so, I couldn't keep a secret.

I knew some of my classmates would eventually assume leadership positions in school districts, so I shared information about the open source applications described below with many of my MacOS or Windows-using classmates. After all, open source software is really about freedom and goodwill. I also wanted them to know that it would be easy to provide their students with world-class applications at little cost. Most of them were surprised and amazed because, as we all know, open source software doesn't have a marketing team except users like you and me.

### My MacOS learning curve

Through this process, I learned some of the nuances of MacOS. While most of the open source tools worked as I was used to, others required different installation methods. Tools like [yum][1], [DNF][2], and [APT][3] do not exist in the MacOS world—and I really missed them.

Some MacOS applications required dependencies and installations that were more difficult than what I was accustomed to with Linux. Nonetheless, I persisted. In the process, I learned how I could keep the best software on my new platform. Even much of MacOS's core is [open source][4].

Also, my Linux background made it easy to get comfortable with the MacOS command line. I still use it to create and copy files, add users, and use other [utilities][5]like cat, tac, more, less, and tail.

### 15 great open source applications for MacOS

  * The college required that I submit most of my work electronically in DOCX format, and I did that easily, first with [OpenOffice][6] and later using [LibreOffice][7] to produce my papers.
  * When I needed to produce graphics for presentations, I used my favorite graphics applications, [GIMP][8] and [Inkscape][9].
  * My favorite podcast creation tool is [Audacity][10]. It's much simpler to use than the proprietary application that ships with the Mac. I use it to record interviews and create soundtracks for video presentations.
  * I discovered early on that I could use the [VideoLan][11] (VLC) media player on MacOS.
  * MacOS's built-in proprietary video creation tool is a good product, but you can easily install and use [OpenShot][12], which is a great content creation tool.
  * When I need to analyze networks for my clients, I use the easy-to-install [Nmap][13] (Network Mapper) and [Wireshark][14] tools on my Mac.
  * I use [VirtualBox][15] for MacOS to demonstrate Raspbian, Fedora, Ubuntu, and other Linux distributions, as well as Moodle, WordPress, Drupal, and Koha when I provide training for librarians and other educators.
  * I make boot drives on my MacBook using [Etcher.io][16]. I just download the ISO file and burn it on a USB stick drive.
  * I think [Firefox][17] is easier and more secure to use than the proprietary browser that comes with the MacBook Pro, and it allows me to synchronize my bookmarks across operating systems.
  * When it comes to eBook readers, [Calibre][18] cannot be beaten. It is easy to download and install, and you can even configure it for a [classroom eBook server][19] with a few clicks.
  * Recently I have been teaching Python to middle school students, I have found it is easy to download and install Python 3 and the IDLE3 editor from [Python.org][20]. I have also enjoyed learning about data science and sharing that with students. Whether you're interested in Python or R, I recommend you download and [install][21] the [Anaconda distribution][22]. It contains the great iPython editor, RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, and JupyterLab, along with some other applications.
  * [HandBrake][23] is a great way to turn your old home video DVDs into MP4s, which you can share on YouTube, Vimeo, or your own [Kodi][24] server on MacOS.
