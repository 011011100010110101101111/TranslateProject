Ubuntu Unity itself is a beautiful desktop but people over the world are smitten by the looks of Mac OS X. If you are among one of those, you don’t need to ditch Ubuntu just for the sake of OS X looks. Instead you can give it a makeover and **make Ubuntu 14.04 look like Mac OS X**.

### Make Ubuntu 14.04 look like Mac OS X ###

To give Ubuntu a makeover of Mac, we shall be using Zukimac theme.

- Get Zukimac theme from the link below:[Download Zukimac Theme for Ubuntu 14.04][1]
- Extract the downloaded zipped file. You will find two directories in there, Zukimac and Zukimac-ml. Copy these to .themes directory in your home directory. Go to Home and press Ctrl+H to show all the hidden folders. If there is no .themes folder here, create one.
- Use [Unity Tweak Tool to change the theme][2].

That’s it. Zukimac gives some a basic look and feel of Mac OS. Here is what it looks like with default OS X Maveric wallpaper.

### Further changes to get Mac feel in Ubuntu 14.04 ###

Additionally, you can **install a dock launcher like Plank** or Docky. To install Plank in Ubuntu 14.04 use the commands below:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ricotz/docky
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install plank

Along with the dock launcher, you can also install S**ynapse indicator as an alternative of Mac Spotlight**. Use the following PPA from Noobslabs to install Synapse indicator:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/apps
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install indicator-synapse

Apart from these two, you can also install **Slingscold launcher, alternative of Mac OS X launchpad**. Use the same Noobslabs PPA as mentioned above to install Slingscold launcher in Ubuntu 14.04:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/apps
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install slingscold

Honestly, I am an avid Ubuntu fan and I like Ubuntu’s default Unity looks. In addition, there are plenty of [beautiful icon themes in Ubuntu 14.04][3] to beautify it. But as I mentioned before there are plenty of people who like Mac OS X and I hope this tutorial helped them to make Ubuntu 14.04 look and feel like Mac OS X.
