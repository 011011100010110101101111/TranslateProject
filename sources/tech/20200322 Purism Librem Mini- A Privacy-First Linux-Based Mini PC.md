Purism Librem Mini: A Privacy-First Linux-Based Mini PC
======

_**Brief: Purism launched a mini PC, “Librem Mini” tailored to provide privacy and security while offering a small form-factor. Here, we talk about the details.**_

[Purism][1] is usually known for services or products that focus on enhancing the digital privacy and security of the user.

Purism flaunts itself as “[Social Purpose Company][2]” aiming to do good for society and they have several services and products to offer in this regard.

While you might be aware of its Librem series of [Linux laptops][3], [Librem One][4] (encrypted services), [PureOS Linux][5], and the [Librem 5 Linux smartphone][6]. Now, they have come up with a small-factor mini PC targeted at the users who want to take control of their privacy and security.

### Librem Mini: Purism’s Mini PC

![Librem Mini PC][7]

[Purism][1]‘s [Librem Mini][8] is intended to be a small, light, and powerful mini computer.

Of course, there are a bunch of [Linux-based mini PCs][9] out there – but Librem Mini specifically focuses on the privacy and security of its users. It comes included with [PureOS][5], [Pureboot][10], and [Librem Key][11] support.

The base configuration will be **available for $699**. Which is expensive than most other mini PCs. But unlike most others, Librem Mini is not a re-branding of [Intel NUC][12]. So, what does it offers then?

### Specifications of Librem Mini

![][13]

Here’s the spec sheet:

  * Intel Core i7-8565U (Whiskey Lake), Active (fan) Cooling
4 Cores, 8 Threads, up to 4.6GHz
  * Intel UHD Graphics 620
  * RAM: Upto 64 GB DDR4 2400 MHz (2 SO-DIMM Slots)
  * 1 SATA III 6GB/s SSD/HDD (7mm)
  * 1 M.2 SSD (SATA III/NVMe x4)
  * 1 HDMI 2.0 4K @ 60Hz
  * 1 DisplayPort 1.2 4K @ 60Hz
  * 4 x USB 3.0
  * 2 x USB 2.0
  * 1 x Type-C 3.1
  * 3.5mm audio jack (Mic-in &amp; headphone out combo)
  * 1 RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet LAN
  * WiFi 802.11n (2.4/5.0 GHz) via Atheros ATH9k module (optional)
  * Bluetooth 4.0 included in WiFi module (optional)
  * Weight: 1 kg (2.2 lbs)
  * Dimensions: 12.8cm (5.0 inches) x 12.8cm (5.0 inches) x 3.8cm (1.5 inches)



I don’t know why they decided for going with Intel’s 8th gen processor considering that 10th gen processor is already in the market. Perhaps because Whiskey Lake is also the latest refresh on the 8th gen processor.

But, yes, just because they have disabled and neutralized Intel’s Management Engine on it – it could be still a viable option to go with.

In addition to that, you should also keep in mind that this mini PC features the ability to detect hardware and software tampering while providing full disk encryption.

And, of course, Linux powers it up.

### Pricing and Availability

![Librem Mini from the back][14]

The base configuration with **8 Gigs of RAM** and a **256 GB SSD** will cost you **$699**. And, if you want the most powerful configuration available, it will cost you about **$3000** easily.

They have a pre-order goal of **$50,000** and they plan to start shipping the units **a month** after reaching the pre-order goal.

So, if you’re going to pre-order now, you should not expect the shipping to start anytime soon. Hence, I recommend you to keep an eye on the pre-order goal on their [Librem Mini product page][8].

**Wrapping Up**

If you’re looking for a mini PC (not specifically tailored for privacy and security), you can have a look at our list of [best Linux based mini PCs][9] to get more ideas.

Librem Mini is definitely going to sound expensive for an average consumer. It is still a decent choice for privacy enthusiasts.
