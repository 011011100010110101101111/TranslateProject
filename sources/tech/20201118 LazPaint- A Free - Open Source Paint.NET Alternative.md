LazPaint: A Free & Open Source Paint.NET Alternative
======

_**Brief: LazPaint is an open-source Paint.NET alternative with cross-platform support. It is a lightweight program with a bunch of essential options to edit images quickly. Here’s an overview of LazPaint.**_

### LazPaint: Open Source Paint.NET Alternative for Linux

![][1]

If you are fond of using tools to quickly edit and manipulate images and screenshots, you may have heard about [Paint.NET][2], which is available only for Windows systems.

It is a popular nifty tool to get a lot of basic editing tasks done along with a bunch of options available. You might be aware of several [ima][3][ge editing tools][3] but Paint.NET is a pretty popular option just because it is easy to use without any bloated feature for an average user.

[LazPaint][4] comes to the rescue as an impressive open source replacement to Paint.NET for Linux, Windows, and macOS. It offers most of the essential features one would need to manipulate images while being easy to use.

Since it is cross-platform application, even if you’re not using a Linux system, you could still start using it as a no-nonsense free and open-source tool, if that’s your priority. Now, let us take a look at some features it offers.

### Features of LazPaint

### Installing LazPaint on Linux

You should find it available in your official repositories to install it via your default package manager but to get the latest version, you will have to download the .**deb** file or compile it from source on non-Debian based Distributions.

I wish there was a Flatpak available to get the latest version on every Linux distribution — but nothing as of now.

It is available for Windows and macOS as well. You will also find a portable version available for Windows, that could come in handy.

### Closing Thoughts on LazPaint

I found it really easy to use and the variety of quality settings to re-sample (or resize) an image is definitely a good addition. If you’ve already installed it, you must have noticed that it does not take a significant amount of storage to get installed and is a lightweight program overall.

It’s snappy, and most of the functions that I tested in my quick usage worked quite well without any issues.
