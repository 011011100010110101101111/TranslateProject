Keyboard Shortcuts to Speed Up Your Work in Linux
======

[![Google Keyboard][1]][2]

_Manipulating the mouse, keyboard and menus takes up a lot of our time, which could be saved by using keyboard shortcuts. These not only save time, but also make the computer user more efficient._

Did you realise that switching from the keyboard to the mouse while typing takes up to two seconds each time? If a person works for eight hours every day, switching from the keyboard to the mouse once a minute, and there are around 240 working days in a year, the amount of time wasted (as per calculations done by Brainscape) is:
_[2 wasted seconds/min] x [480 minutes per day] x 240 working days per year = 64 wasted hours per year_
This is equal to eight working days lost and hence learning keyboard shortcuts will increase productivity by 3.3 per cent (_<https://www.brainscape.com/blog/2011/08/keyboard-shortcuts-economy/>_).

Keyboard shortcuts provide a quicker way to do a task, which otherwise would have had to be done in multiple steps using the mouse and/or the menu. Figure 1 gives a list of a few most frequently used shortcuts in Ubuntu 18.04 Linux OS and the Web browsers. I am omitting the very well-known shortcuts like copy, paste, etc, and the ones which are not used frequently. The readers can refer to online resources for a comprehensive list of shortcuts. Note that the Windows key is renamed as Super key in Linux.

**General shortcuts**

[![][11]][12]You can also configure your own custom shortcuts in Ubuntu, as follows:

  * Click on Settings in Ubuntu Dash.
  * Select the Devices tab in the left menu of the Settings window.
  * Select the Keyboard tab in the Devices menu.
  * The ‘+’ button is displayed at the bottom of the right panel. Click on the ‘+’ sign to open the custom shortcut dialogue box and configure a new shortcut.



Learning three shortcuts mentioned in this article can save a lot of time and make you more productive.
