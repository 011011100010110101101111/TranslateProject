**Curlew, an easy to use, free, and open source multimedia converter for Linux, has reached version 0.1.22.3.**

Curlew can be used to convert more than 100 different formats, show detailed file information, preview conversion, insert subtitles, and much more.

According to the changelog, the last size and position is now remembered from one instance to another, a few missing dialog icons have been added, and the filesystem is now synced before suspending.

The application has a number of dependencies: at least python version 2.7 (no more than 3.0), python-gobject 3.0, gir1.2-gtk 3.0, ffmpeg 0.8, libav-tools 0.8, mencoder, libavcodec-extra, xdg-utils, and mediainfo.

The guys from noobslab.com also provide an easy way of installing the application with the help of a PPA. All you have to do is to enter a few commands in the terminal (you will need to be root in order to make it work):

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/apps
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install curlew

Check out the official [changelog][1] for a complete list of new features and updates.

You can download the Curlew 0.1.22.3 source package:

- [Ubuntu 14.04 DEB ALL][2][ubuntu_deb] [172 KB]
- [tar.gz][3][sources] [152 KB]

Remember that this is a development version and it should NOT be installed on production machines. It is intended for testing purposes only.
