4 Free and Open Source Alternatives to Adobe Photoshop
======

_**Looking for a free Photoshop alternative? Here are some of the best free and open source software that you can use instead of Adobe Photoshop.**_

Adobe Photoshop is a premium image editing and design tool available for Windows and macOS. Undoubtedly, almost everyone knows about it. It’s that popular. Well, you can use Photoshop on Linux using Windows in a virtual machine or by [using Wine][1] – but that is not an ideal experience.

In general, we don’t have a lot of options available as a replacement for Adobe Photoshop. However, in this article, we shall mention some of the best open-source Photoshop alternatives available for Linux (with cross-platform support as well).

Do note that Photoshop is not just a photo editor. It’s used by photographers, digital artists, professional editors for various usage. The alternative software here may not have all the features of Photoshop but you can use them for various task that you do in Photoshop.

### Open Source Alternatives to Adobe Photoshop for Linux, Windows and macOS

Initially, I thought of focusing only on Photoshop alternatives for Linux but why confine this list for Linux only? Other operating system users should also use the open source software.

_**If you are using Linux, all the mentioned software should be available in the repositories of your distribution. You can install it using the software center or the package manager.**_

For other platforms, please check the official project websites to get the installer files.

_The list is in no particular order of ranking_.
