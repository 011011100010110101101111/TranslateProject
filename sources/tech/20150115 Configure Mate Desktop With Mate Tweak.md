[Installing Mate Desktop in Ubuntu][1] is one thing but you might be wondering about how to **configure Mate Desktop**? Most of the desktop environments have their own tweaking tools. For example Unity has Unity Tweak Tool, GNOME has Gnome Tweak Tool, Elementary OS has Elementary Tweak Tool. Good news is that Mate Desktop too has its own configuration tweak tool, named [Mate Tweak][2].

Mate Tweak is a fork of [mintDesktop][3], a configuration tool for Linux Mint.

### Install Mate Tweak to configure Mate Desktop ###

Mate Tweak can be easily installed in Ubuntu and Ubuntu based system via its official PPA. Open a terminal and use the following commands:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-mate-dev/ppa
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install mate-tweak

You can control what shows on the desktop, buttons layout and other interface tweaks and windows behavior. Compare to Unity and Gnome tweak tools, Mate Tweak doesn’t have much to offer in terms of tweaking. For example you can still not [change themes][4] with it but at least it provides an easier way to change some configuration. I hope that it will have more features in near future.
