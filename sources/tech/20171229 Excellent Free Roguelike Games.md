![地牢][1]

Roguelike is a sub-genre of role-playing games. It literally means "a game like Rogue". Rogue is a dungeon crawling video game, first released in 1980 by developers Michel Toy, Glenn Wichman and Ken Arnold. The game stood out from the crowd by being fiendishly addictive. The game's goal was to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, hidden deep in the 26th level, and ascend back to the top, all set in a world based on Dungeons & Dragons.
Roguelike 属于角色扮演游戏的一个子流派，它从字面上理解就是“类 Rogue 游戏”。Rogue 是一个地牢爬行视频游戏，第一个版本由开发者 Michel Toy、Glenn Wichman 和 Ken Arnold 在 1980 年发布，由于极易上瘾使得它从一众游戏中脱颖而出。整个游戏的目标是深入第 26 层，取回 Yendor 的护身符并回到地面，所有设定都基于龙与地下城的世界观。

The game is rightly considered to be a classic, formidably difficult yet compelling addictive. While it was popular in college and university campuses, it wasn't a big seller. At the time of its release, Rogue wasn't published under an open source license, which led to many clones being developed.
Rogue 被认为是一个经典、极其困难并且让人废寝忘食的游戏。虽然它在大学校园中非常受欢迎，但并不非常畅销。在 Rogue 发布时，它并没有使用开源证书，导致了爱好者们开发了许多克隆版本。

There is no exact definition of a roguelike, but this type of game typically has the following characteristics:
对于 Roguelike 游戏并没有一个明确的定义，但是此类游戏会拥有下述的典型特征：

  * High fantasy narrative background
  * 高度魔幻的叙事背景；
  * Procedural level generation. Most of the game world is generated by the game for every new gameplay session. This is meant to encourage replayability
  * 程序化生成关卡。游戏世界中的大部分地图在每次开始游戏时重新生成，也就意味着鼓励多周目；
  * Turn-based dungeon exploration and combat
  * 回合制的地牢探险和战斗；
  * Tile-based graphics that are randomly generated
  * 基于图块随机生成的图形；
  * Random conflict outcomes
  * 随机的战斗结果；
  * Permanent death - death works realistically, once you're gone, you're gone
  * 永久死亡——死亡现实地起作用，一旦死亡你就需要重新开始
  * High difficulty
  * 高难度



This article compiles a wide selection of roguelike games available for Linux. If you enjoy addictive gameplay with real intensity, I heartily recommended downloading these games. Don't be put off by the primitive graphics offered by many of the games, you'll soon forget the visuals once you get immersed in playing. Remember, in roguelikes game mechanics tend to be the primary focus, with graphics being a welcome, but not essential, addition.
