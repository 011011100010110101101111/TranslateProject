Wine 5.0 is Released! Here’s How to Install it
======

_**Brief: A new major release of Wine is here. With Wine 5.0, running Windows applications and games on Linux is further improved.**_

With some efforts, you can [run Windows applications on Linux][1] using Wine. Wine is a tool that you may try when you must use a software that is available only on Windows. It supports a number of such software.

A new major release for Wine has landed i.e Wine 5.0, almost after a year of its 4.0 release.

Wine 5.0 release introduces a couple of major features and a lot of significant changes/improvements. In this article, I’ll highlight what’s new and also mention the installation instructions.

### What’s New In Wine 5.0?

The key changes in 5.0 release as mentioned in their [official announcement][3]:

  * Builtin modules in PE format.
  * Multi-monitor support.
  * XAudio2 reimplementation.
  * Vulkan 1.1 support.
  * Microsoft Installer (MSI) Patch Files are supported.
  * Performance improvements.



So, with Vulkan 1.1 support and multi-monitor support – Wine 5.0 release is a big deal.

In addition to the key highlights, you can also expect better controller support in the new version considering thousands of changes/improvements involved in the new release.

It is also worth noting that this release is being dedicated to the memory of **Józef Kucia** (_lead developer of the vkd3d project_)

They’ve also mentioned this in their [release notes][4]:

> This release is dedicated to the memory of Józef Kucia, who passed away in August 2019 at the young age of 30. Józef was a major contributor to Wine’s Direct3D implementation, and the lead developer of the vkd3d project. His skills and his kindness are sorely missed by all of us.

### How to install Wine 5.0 on Ubuntu and Linux Mint

Note

_If you have Wine installed before, you should remove it completely to avoid any conflict (as you wish). Also, the WineHQ key repository key was changed recently, you should refer to its_ [_download page_][5] _for additional instructions on that according to your Linux distribution._

The source for Wine 5.0 is available on its [official website][3]. You can read more about [building wine][6] in order to make it work. Arch-based users should be getting it soon.

Here’ I’ll show you the steps to install Wine 5.0 on Ubuntu and other Ubuntu-based distributions.

First, remove existing Wine install with this command:

```
sudo apt remove winehq-stable wine-stable wine1.6
```

Download the official Wine repository key and add it:

```
wget -qO - https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

_**Now the next step involves adding the repository and for that, you need to [know your Ubuntu version][7] first.**_

For **Ubuntu 19.10**, add this repository:

```
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/ eoan main'
```

If you are using **Ubuntu 18.04** or **Linux Mint 19.x**, use this command to add the repository:

```
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/ bionic main'
```

For **Ubuntu 16.04 and Linux Mint 18.x series**, you can use this command:

```
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/ xenial main'
```

Now that you have added the correct repository, you can install Wine 5.0 using this command:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-stable
```

**Wrapping Up**
