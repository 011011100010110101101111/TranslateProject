How To Protect Ubuntu Server Against the GHOST Vulnerability
================================================================================
On January 27, 2015, a GNU C Library (glibc) vulnerability, referred to as the GHOST vulnerability, was announced to the general public. In summary, the vulnerability allows remote attackers to take complete control of a system by exploiting a buffer overflow bug in glibc's GetHOST functions.Check more details from [here][1]

The GHOST vulnerability can be exploited on Linux systems that use versions of the GNU C Library prior to glibc-2.18. That is, systems that use an unpatched version of glibc from versions 2.2 to 2.17 are at risk. 

### Check System Vulnerability ###

You can use the following command to check the glib version 

    ldd --version

### Output ###

ldd (Ubuntu GLIBC 2.19-10ubuntu2) **2.19**

The glib version should be above 2.17 and from the output we are running 2.19.If you are seeing glib version between 2.2 to 2.17 then you need to run the following commands

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

After the installation you need to reboot the server using the following command

    sudo reboot

After reboot use the same command again and check the glib version.
