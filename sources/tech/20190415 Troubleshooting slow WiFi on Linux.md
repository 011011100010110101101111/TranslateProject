Troubleshooting slow WiFi on Linux
======

I'm no stranger to diagnosing hardware problems on [Linux systems][1]. Even though most of my professional work over the past few years has involved virtualization, I still enjoy crouching under desks and fumbling around with devices and memory modules. Well, except for the "crouching under desks" part. But none of that means that persistent and mysterious bugs aren't frustrating. I recently faced off against one of those bugs on my Ubuntu 18.04 workstation, which remained unsolved for months.

Here, I'll share my problem and my many attempts to resolve it. Even though you'll probably never encounter my specific issue, the troubleshooting process might be helpful. And besides, you'll get to enjoy feeling smug at how much time and effort I wasted following useless leads.
