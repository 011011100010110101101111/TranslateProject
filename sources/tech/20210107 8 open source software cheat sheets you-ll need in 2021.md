Sometimes you need the short version. You know what you want to do and you just can't recall exactly how to do it. That's when cheat sheets come in handy. In this article, I suggest a cheat sheet to get you going with MariaDB and MySQL. This cheat sheet is great for the occassional database user. Next, I have listed two Raspberry Pi cheat sheets. The first gets you started with this single-board computer. Once you're comfortable with the basics, turn it into a home lab and begin working with Kubernetes container management. Be sure to grab the next cheat sheet at the same time, because it covers the kubectl tool. Next, there is a great cheat sheet for Emacs, and another for the C programming language. Finally, the list concludes with two very practical cheat sheets: Collaboration tools and open source alternatives.

Here is the list:
