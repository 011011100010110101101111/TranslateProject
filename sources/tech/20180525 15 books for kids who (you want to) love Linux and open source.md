In my job I've heard professionals in tech, from C-level executives to everyone in between, say they want their own kids to learn more about [Linux][1] and [open source][2]. Some of them seem to have an easy time with their kids following closely in their footsteps. And some have a tough time getting their kids to see what makes Linux and open source so cool. Maybe their time will come, maybe it won't. There's a lot of interesting, valuable stuff out there in this big world.

Either way, if you have a kid or know a kid that may be interested in learning more about making something with code or hardware, from games to robots, this list is for you.

### 15 books for kids with a focus on Linux and open source

[Adventures in Raspberry Pi][3] by Carrie Anne Philbin

Drawing on experiences from more than 30 years at MIT's Media Lab, Resnick discusses new technologies and strategies for engaging young people in creative learning experiences.
