Who doesn't like a good read? Instead of frittering away your time on social media or a [messaging app][2], you can enjoy a book, magazine, or another document on your Android-powered phone or tablet.
谁不想有一个好的阅读体验？你可以在自己安卓手机或平板上阅读一本书、杂志或其他文本，而非在社交媒体或即时信息软件中浪费你的时间。

To do that, all you need is the right eBook reader app. So let's take a look at four solid, open source eBook readers for Android.
要做到这一点，你需要的只是一个正确的电子书阅读软件。接下来让我们来看一看四款开源可靠的安卓电子书阅读器。

### Book Reader

Let's start off with my favorite open source Android eBook reader: [Book Reader][3]. It's based on the older, open source version of the now-proprietary FBReader app. Like earlier versions of its progenitor, Book Reader is simple and minimal, but it does a great job.
那我们先从我最喜欢的一款开源安卓电子书阅读器开始：Book Reader。它是基于更老版本而现在已拥有专利的FBReader软件。像它祖先的更古老的版本，Book Reader简易又轻巧，但好用。

**Pros of Book Reader:**
Book Reader的支持者

  * It's easy to use.它容易上手。
  * The app's interface follows Android's [Material Design guidelines][4], so it's very clean.软件接口继承安卓的材料设计指南，因此它非常整洁。
  * You can add bookmarks to an eBook and share text with other apps on your device.你可以给电子书添加书签并把文本分享到你设备上的其他app里。
  * There's growing support for languages other than English.支持英语外的更多其他语言



**Cons of Book Reader:**
Book Reader的反对者

  * Book Reader has a limited number of configuration options.Book Reader有许多限制配置选项。
  * There's no built-in dictionary or support for an external dictionary.没有内置词典或支持外部词典的功能



**Supported eBook formats:**
支持的电子书格式

Book Reader supports EPUB, .mobi, PDF, [DjVu][5], HTML, plain text, Word documents, RTF, and [FictionBook][6].

Book Reader可在GNU通用公共许可版本3.0下运行，你可以在GitLab中找到它。

### Cool Reader

[Cool Reader][9] is a zippy and easy-to-use eBook app. While I think the app's icons are reminiscent of those found in Windows Vista, Cool Reader does have several useful features.
Cool Reader是一个灵活且易于使用的电子书app。！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！

**Pros of Cool Reader:**

  * It's highly configurable. You can change fonts, line and paragraph spacing, hyphenation, font sizes, margins, and background colors.它高度自定义，你可以改变字体、行宽、段间距、连字符、字体大小、页边距和背景色。
  * You can override the stylesheet in a book. I found this useful with two or three books that set all text in small capital letters.你可以覆盖书中的样式表。我发现它在两三本设置所有文本为小写字母的书中很有用。
  * It automatically scans your device for new books when you start it up. You can also access books on [Project Gutenberg][10] and the [Internet Archive][11].
  它会在启动时自动搜索你的设备来寻找新的电子书资源。你也可以查阅古登堡计划和互联网档案馆中的书籍。



**Cons of Cool Reader:**

  * Cool Reader doesn't have the cleanest or most modern interface.Cool Reader没有极简或者前卫的接口。
  * While it's usable out of the box, you really need to do a bit of configuration to make Cool Reader comfortable to use.虽然它开箱即用，但你真的需要调整一些配置来更舒适地使用Cool Reader。
  * The app's default dictionary is proprietary, although you can swap it out for [an open one][12].app的默认词典是有专利的，尽管你可以用开源的词典来替换掉它。



**Supported eBook formats:**

You can use Cool Reader to browse EPUB, FictionBook, plain text, RTF, HTML, [Compiled HTML Help][13] (.chm), and TCR (the eBook format for the Psion series of handheld computers) files.

![Cool Reader Android app][14]

Cool Reader's source code is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2, and you can find it on [Sourceforge][15].

### KOReader

[KOReader][16] was originally created for [E Ink][17] eBook readers but found its way to Android. While testing it, I found KOReader to be both useful and frustrating in equal measures. It's definitely not a bad app, but it's not my first choice.
KOReader最初是为了电子墨水电子书阅读器发明的，但发现它适用于安卓。在同等条件下测试它时，我发现KOReader既有用又让人失望。很明显它是一个不错的软件，但不会是我的首选。

**Pros of KOReader:**

  * It's highly configurable.高度自定义
  * It supports multiple languages.支持多种语言
  * It allows you to look up words using a [dictionary][18] (if you have one installed) or Wikipedia (if you're connected to the internet).它允许你使用词典（如果你已安装）或者Wikipedia（如果你有网）来查单词。



**Cons of KOReader:**

  * You need to change the settings for each book you read. KOReader doesn't remember settings when you open a new book.每读一本书你都需要改变设置。在你新阅读一本书书时，KOReader不会保存相关配置
  * The interface is reminiscent of a dedicated eBook reader. The app doesn't have that Android look and feel.它的界面让人觉得是一个专用电子书阅读器。app没有安卓的外形和感觉。



**Supported eBook formats:**

You can view PDF, DjVu, CBT, and [CBZ][5] eBooks. It also supports EPUB, FictionBook, .mobi, Word documents, text files, and [Compiled HTML Help][13] (.chm) files.

![KOReader Android app][19]
你可以查看PDF, DjVu, CBT, 和CBZ格式的电子书，同时也支持！！！！！！！！文件。

KOReader's source code is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3.0, and you can find it on [GitHub][20].

### Booky McBookface

Yes, that really is the name of [this eBook reader][21]. It's the most basic of the eBook readers in this article but don't let that (or the goofy name) put you off. Booky McBookface is easy to use and does the one thing it does quite well.

**Pros of Booky McBookface:**

  * There are no frills. It's just you and your eBook.
  * The interface is simple and clean.
  * Long-tapping the app's icon in the Android Launcher pops up a menu from which you can open the last book you were reading, get a list of unread books, or find and open a book on your device.



**Cons of Booky McBookface:**

  * The app has few configuration options—you can change the size of the font and the brightness, and that's about it.
  * You need to use the buttons at the bottom of the screen to navigate through an eBook. Tapping the edges of the screen doesn't work.
  * You can't add bookmarks to an eBook.



**Supported eBook formats:**

You can read eBooks in EPUB, HTML, or plain text formats with Booky McBookface.

![Booky McBookface Android app][22]

Booky McBookface's source code is available under the GNU General Public License version 3.0, and you can find it [on GitHub][23].
