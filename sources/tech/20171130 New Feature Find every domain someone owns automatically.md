New Feature: Find every domain someone owns automatically
============================================================


Today, we are excited to announce our latest feature which we have been working on for the past weeks. It is the Whois aggregation tool that is now available on [DNSTrails][1].

In the past, searching for domain owners took lot of time, because most of the time you needed to have the domain names pointed to an IP address in order to find the rest of the domains owned by the same person.

Using that old method you could easily lose hours and hours each day by researching and crossing results and data between one tool and another until you got the domain list you wanted.

Thanks to this new tool and our intelligent [WHOIS database][2], now you can search for any domain name and get the full list of domains registered by that organization or person and get accurate results within seconds.

### How can I use the Whois aggregation feature?

Step 1: Open up [DNSTrails.com][3]

Step 2: Search for any domain name, for example: godaddy.com

Step 3: After you get the results for the domain name, locate the Whois information block as you see below:

Step 4: You will notice there is a phone number and email address associated with the domain name.

Step 5: Click on the links at the right, you will easily find the rest of the domain names registered with the same telephone and email address.

This means, that even if the domains doesn't even have IPs pointed at the registrar, we can still discover the rest of the domains if they use the same phone and mail address, pretty useful if you are investigating domain ownership from any individual on the Internet.

Ever wanted to know which other domains are owned by a person? Try the [WHOIS aggregation feature][4] at [DNStrails][5] yourself or [get in touch with us for API access][6].
