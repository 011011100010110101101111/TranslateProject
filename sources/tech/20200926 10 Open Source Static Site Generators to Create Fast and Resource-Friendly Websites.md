10 Open Source Static Site Generators to Create Fast and Resource-Friendly Websites
======

_**Brief: Looking to deploy a static web-page? No need to fiddle with HTML and CSS. These open source static website generators will help you deploy beautiful, functional static websites in no time.**_

### What is a static website?

Technically, a static website means the webpages are not generated on the server dynamically. The HTML, CSS, JavaScript lie on the server in the version the end user receives it. The raw source code files are already prebuilt, the source code doesn’t change with the next server request.

It’s FOSS is a dynamic website which depends on several databases and the web pages are generated and served when there’s a request from your browser. Majority of the web is powered by dynamic sites where you interact with the websites and there are plenty of content that often change.

Static websites give you a few benefits like faster loading times, less server resource requirements, and better security (debatable?).

Traditionally, static websites are more suitable for creating small websites with only a few pages and where the content doesn’t change too often.

This, however, is changing thanks to static website generator tools and you can use them to create blogs as well.

I have compiled a list of open source static site generators that can help you build a beautiful website.

### Best Open Source Static Site Generators

It’s worth noting that you will not get complex functionality on a static website. In that case, you might want to check out our list of [best open source CMS][1] for dynamic websites.

#### 1\. Jekyll

![][2]

Jekyll is one of the most popular open source static generator built using [Ruby][3]. In fact, Jekyll is the engine behind [GitHub pages][4] which lets you host websites using GitHub for free.

Setting up Jekyll is easy across multiple platforms which includes Ubuntu as well. It utilizes [Markdown][5], [Liquid][5] (for template), HTML, and CSS to generate the static site files. It is also a pretty good option if you want to build a blog without advertisements or a product page to promote your tool or service.

Also, it supports migrating your blog from popular CMSs like Ghost, WordPress, Drupal 7, and more. You get to manage permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts, which is nice. So, even if you already have an existing website that you want to convert to a static site, Jekyll should be a perfect solution. You can learn more about it by exploring the [official documentation][6] or its [GitHub page][7].
