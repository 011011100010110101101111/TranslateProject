### 区块链 2.0：“更”智能的房地产

在本系列的[上一篇文章][1]中探讨了区块链的特征，这些区块链将使机构能够将**传统银行**和**融资系统**转换和交织在一起。这部分将探讨**房地产区块链**。房地产业正在走向革命。它是人类已知的最活跃、交易最重要的资产类别之一。然而，由于充满了监管障碍和欺诈、欺骗的无数可能性，它也是最难参与交易的之一。利用适当的共识算法的区块链的分布式分类账本功能被吹捧为这个行业的前进方向，而这个行业传统上被认为其面对变革是保守的。

就其无数的业务而言，房地产一直是一个非常保守的行业。这似乎也是理所当然的。2008 年金融危机或 20 世纪上半叶的大萧条等重大经济危机成功摧毁了该行业及其参与者。然而，与大多数具有经济价值的产品一样，房地产行业具有弹性，而这种弹性则源于其保守性。

全球房地产市场包括价值 228 万亿 [^1] 美元的资产类别。给予或接受。其他投资资产，如股票、债券和股票合计价值仅为 170 万亿美元。显然，在这样一个行业中实施的任何和所有交易在很大程度上都是自然精心策划和精心执行的。在大多数情况下，房地产也因许多欺诈事件而臭名昭着，并且随之而来的是毁灭性的损失。由于其运营非常保守，该行业也难以驾驭。它受到严格法律的严格监管，创造了一个交织在一起的细微差别网络，这对于普通人来说太难以完全理解。使得大多数人无法进入和参与。如果你曾参与过这样的交易，那么你就会知道纸质文件的重要性和长期性。


Starting with a trivial albeit an important example to show just how bad the current record management practices are in the real estate sector, consider the **Title Insurance business** [2], [3]. Title Insurance is used to hedge against the possibility of the land’s titles and ownership records being inadmissible and hence unenforceable. An insurance product such as this is also referred to as an indemnity cover. It is by law required in many cases that properties have title insurance, especially when dealing with property that has changed hands multiple times over the years. Mortgage firms might insist on the same as well when they back real estate deals. The fact that a product of this kind has existed since the 1850s and that it does business worth at least **$1.5 trillion a year in the US alone** is a testament to the statement at the start. A revolution in terms of how these records are maintained is imperative to have in this situation and the blockchain provides a sustainable solution. Title fraud averages around $100k per case on average as per the **American Land Title Association** and 25% of all titles involved in transactions have an issue regarding their documents[4]. The blockchain allows for setting up an immutable permanent database that will track the property itself, recording each and every transaction or investment that has gone into it. Such a ledger system will make life easier for everyone involved in the real estate industry including one-time home buyers and make financial products such as Title Insurance basically irrelevant. Converting a physical asset such as real estate to a digital asset like this is unconventional and is extant only in theory at the moment. However, such a change is imminent sooner rather than later[5].

Among the areas in which blockchain will have the most impact within real estate is as highlighted above in maintaining a transparent and secure title management system for properties. A blockchain based record of the property can contain information about the property, its location, history of ownership, and any related public record of the same[6]. This will permit closing real estate deals fast and obliviates the need for 3rd party monitoring and oversight. Tasks such as real estate appraisal and tax calculations become matters of tangible objective parameters rather than subjective measures and guesses because of reliable historical data which is publicly verifiable. **UBITQUITY** is one such platform that offers customized blockchain-based solutions to enterprise customers. The platform allows customers to keep track of all property details, payment records, mortgage records and even allows running smart contracts that’ll take care of taxation and leasing automatically[7].

This brings us to the second biggest opportunity and use case of blockchains in real estate. Since the sector is highly regulated by numerous 3rd parties apart from the counterparties involved in the trade, due-diligence and financial evaluations can be significantly time-consuming. These processes are predominantly carried out using offline channels and paperwork needs to travel for days before a final evaluation report comes out. This is especially true for corporate real estate deals and forms a bulk of the total billable hours charged by consultants. In case the transaction is backed by a mortgage, duplication of these processes is unavoidable. Once combined with digital identities for the people and institutions involved along with the property, the current inefficiencies can be avoided altogether and transactions can take place in a matter of seconds. The tenants, investors, institutions involved, consultants etc., could individually validate the data and arrive at a critical consensus thereby validating the property records for perpetuity[8]. This increases the accuracy of verification manifold. Real estate giant **RE/MAX** has recently announced a partnership with service provider **XYO Network Partners** for building a national database of real estate listings in Mexico. They hope to one day create one of the largest (as of yet) decentralized real estate title registry in the world[9].

However, another significant and arguably a very democratic change that the blockchain can bring about is with respect to investing in real estate. Unlike other investment asset classes where even small household investors can potentially participate, real estate often requires large hands-down payments to participate. Companies such as **ATLANT** and **BitOfProperty** tokenize the book value of a property and convert them into equivalents of a cryptocurrency. These tokens are then put for sale on their exchanges similar to how stocks and shares are traded. Any cash flow that the real estate property generates afterward is credited or debited to the token owners depending on their “share” in the property[4].

However, even with all of that said, Blockchain technology is still in very early stages of adoption in the real estate sector and current regulations are not exactly defined for it to be either[8]. Concepts such as distributed applications, distributed anonymous organizations, smart contracts etc., are unheard of in the legal domain in many countries. A complete overhaul of existing regulations and guidelines once all the stakeholders are well educated on the intricacies of the blockchain is the most pragmatic way forward. Again, it’ll be a slow and gradual change to go through, however a much-needed one nonetheless. The next article of the series will look at how **“Smart Contracts”** , such as those implemented by companies such as UBITQUITY and XYO are created and executed in the blockchain.
