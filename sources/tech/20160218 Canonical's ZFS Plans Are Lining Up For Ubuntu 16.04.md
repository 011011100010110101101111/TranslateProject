Canonical's ZFS Plans Are Lining Up For Ubuntu 16.04
=======================================================

Ubuntu developers have been working on [ZFS support for Ubuntu 16.04](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=ZFS-For-Ubuntu-16.04) and all of that file-system support is getting squared away. 

EXT4 will continue to be the default for Ubuntu 16.04 installations, but ZFS support will be automatically built into the Ubuntu Linux kernel releases, the module will automatically load when needed, zfsutils-linux is part of the main Ubuntu archive, and the support is being backed to commercial customers via Canonical. 

For those interested in official ZFS support for Ubuntu Linux, Canonical's Dustin Kirkland has written [a new blog post](http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2016/02/zfs-is-fs-for-containers-in-ubuntu-1604.html) covering some of the details and why "ZFS is *the* FS for Containers in Ubuntu 16.04!"
