Build an integration for GitHub
=============

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4432363/17537572/934e2f9c-5e52-11e6-9c24-50c7be5b5ae3.png)

You can now access more tools from our [Integrations Directory][1]. The Directory now has more than 15 categories — from [API management][2] to [application monitoring][3], there's a GitHub integration to support every stage of your development cycle.

We're inviting developers of all levels of expertise to create an integration that will help developers work better. If you've built a great integration for GitHub, we want to highlight it! [Gitter][4], [AppVeyor][5], and [ZenHub][6] did it, and so can you.

### What we're looking for

Good software development relies on quality tools and developers today have a wide range of choices—language, framework, workflow, and environment among other factors. We're looking for tools that create a better overall development experience.

#### A couple of guidelines for Integrations Directory listings:

- Demonstrates solid growth (you should currently have over 500 users via GitHub OAuth)
- Meets our [Technical Requirements][7]
- Follows our [Terms of Service][8] and [Privacy Policy][9]
- Focuses on the software development life cycle

### Helpful resources

To get listed, please follow the steps outlined in the [listing requirements page][10].

You also should read our[ marketing guidelines][11] and the [existing Directory listings][12] to get a better idea of how to put it all together. Please draft the content for your listing in a [secret gist][13] (markdown format) and email us at <partnerships@github.com>. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at <partnerships@github.com>.
