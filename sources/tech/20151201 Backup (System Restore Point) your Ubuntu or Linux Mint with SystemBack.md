Backup (System Restore Point) your Ubuntu/Linux Mint with SystemBack
================================================================================
System Restore is must have feature for any OS that allows the user to revert their computer's state (including system files, installed applications, and system settings) to that of a previous point in time, which can be used to recover from system malfunctions or other problems.
Sometimes installing a program or driver can make your OS go to blank screen. System Restore can return your PC's system files and programs to a time when everything was working fine, potentially preventing hours of troubleshooting headaches. It won't affect your documents, pictures, or other data.
Simple system backup and restore application with extra features. [Systemback][1] makes it easy to create backups of system and users configuration files. In case of problems you can easily restore the previous state of the system. There are extra features like system copying, system installation and Live system creation.

**Note**: Using System Restore will not restore documents, music, emails, or personal files of any kind. Depending on your perspective, this is both a positive and negative feature. The bad news is that it won't restore that accidentally deleted file you wish you could get back, though a file recovery program might solve that problem.
If no restore point exists on your computer, System Restore has nothing to revert to so the tool won't work for you. If you're trying to recover from a major problem, you'll need to move on to another troubleshooting step.
