Looking for ways to beautify your system running Ubuntu 14.04? Why not change the icon themes? If you are not aware of some good icon sets, I have compiled a list of some **best icon set for Ubuntu 14.04**. But before we look at the icons, lets first see how to use the icon themes.

### How to use a new icon set in Ubuntu: ###

You can install a new icon set in two ways. One is by adding a PPA. You add the PPA, install the icon set. But you won’t find icon sets for all the icon themes. Therefore, the other way round is to download the compressed file and extract it to **~/.icons**. If this directory doesn’t exist, create one using the following command:

    mkdir ~/.icons

The icons extracted in the above directory will be available for the current user only. If you want the icons to be available for all the users, you should extract the icons to **/usr/share/icons**.

Now, once you have installed the icon set, you can use a [Unity Tweak Tool][1] to change the icon theme. Use the following command to install Unity Tweak Tool:

    sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool

Once installed, run the tool and click on **Icons** under **Appearance** section:

You can select your preferred icon set among the available ones here. Now you now how to change icons in Ubuntu, lets take a look at some of the best icon themes for Ubuntu.
