**Audacity, a tool that can be used to record live audio through a microphone or mixer, or digitize recordings from cassette tapes, records, or mini-discs, is now at version 2.0.5 RC1**

Audacity 2.0.5 RC1 comes with a ton of features and can record from microphone, line input, USB/Firewire devices, and more. It can also manage multiple input and output devices, dub over existing tracks to create multi-track recordings, record at sample rates up to 192,000 Hz (subject to appropriate hardware), and record multiple channels at once.

**Highlights of Audacity 2.0.5 RC1:**

- The separate commands that aligned track start or end with the cursor or with selection start are now combined into "Cursor/Selection Start" commands;
- "Align and Move Cursor" has been renamed to "Move Selection when Aligning";
- Labels Editor now allows empty labels to be saved on closing the editor;
- PortAudio has been updated to version r1910 to fix memory leaks and other bugs under ALSA.

A complete list of changes, updates, and new features can be found in the [changelog][1].
