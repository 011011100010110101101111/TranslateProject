**The tantalising trials of taxonomy are complete: the mascot for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS has been chosen – get used to typing out the name ‘Trusty Tahr’.**

“*What’s a…tahr?*”, you ask? Google tells me it’s a goat-like mammal found in mountainous areas in Oman, India and the Himalayas.

The sure-footed animal reflects the goals for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, which [Shuttleworth says][1], will see conservative choices made on the desktop as it focuses on delivering “*…performance, refinement, maintainability [and] technical debt.*” 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for servers and desktops is pencilled in for release in April 2014.
