MineSweeper Touch enriched with beautiful Suru elements
================================================================================
Design is a vital part of Ubuntu's next-generation components, design being progressively yet-already-visible implemented in areas, elements, widgets, etc, overall design energy taking the next-generation components of Ubuntu to a superior, modern, innovative level.

Part of the official design process is Suru, essentially, a set of visual patterns expressed through colored backgrounds, interesting shapes and chic, stylish blocks, resulting (when utilized) truly beautiful applications.

Suru is a first-class citizen in the official core applications, yet, there are also third-party applications already using various Suru variations, among which MineSweeper Touch.

[MineSweeper Touch](https://launchpad.net/minesweeper-touch) is a now-fancy game incarnating the lovely classic MineSweeper game into an Ubuntu SDK interface; recently, MineSweeper Touch was enriched with a definitely interesting look & feel, incorporating the modern Suru style into its views.

The result: launching MineSweeper Touch, the user is to notice the purple background sustaining the rounded red-to-purple square blocks, white-ish when-unveiled blocks, distinct container for blocks, as well as carved areas where the game's details are exposed.
