Tuxmachines.org for sale
================================================================================
![](http://www.tuxmachines.org/images/forsale.jpg)

I've decided to try and see if anyone might be interested in buying and doing something with my domain and site. So, today, I'm posting this ad here: tuxmachines.org for sale.

I'm just getting too old and tired to keep the site up with way it and its loyal visitors deserve. It may get better next spring, but this fall I'll end up losing all my visitors I'm afraid.

I don't have any unrealistic ideas of what this site is worth or what anyone might pay, especially these days. I'll entertain any offer and will probably accept much lower than one might think.

So, if you'd like to have your own Linux site and don't want to start from scratch, here's a perfect choice. You'll get the artwork, theme, database, files, pictures, domain name (and anything else I may have forgotten) - or just the domain - whatever you want.

Just make an offer to srlinuxx at gmail dot com.

PS. I guess if the site doesn't sell, things will continue to be slow through the new year, but I'm hoping things will be better then*. I'll continue to do my best, so, keep your bookmarks or news feeds, please.

\* I'll blog more about this later.
