Install Cinnamon 1.8 in Ubuntu 13.04
================================================================================
We have talked about what [Cinnamon][1] and [Nemo File Manage][2])r is in some of our [previous articles][3]. But if you still don’t know what Cinnamon is, here you are:

Cinnamon is a desktop environment developed by the [Linux Mint][4] Team initially for Linux Mint. The desktop environment offers a more comfortable and modern experience to users.

If you love Unity (Ubuntu Default) like I do so much. I will advice you to try Cinnamon once and see. Installing Cinnamon doesn’t mean you elimination Unity. NO.

The latest version of Cinnamon 1.8 is not yet available in Ubuntu repositories hence thanks to PPA, we can.

Some new features have been included in Cinnamon 1.8 including Screensaver, Cinnamon Control Center and [more][5].

**Installing Cinnamon.**

Open the Terminal and the run the following commands:

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install cinnamon nemo

After installing Cinnamon and Nemo File Manager successfully, just log out or Restart your system.

Click on the **Ubuntu logo** at the **right top corner** of your **username** on the **log on screen**. You should see **Cinnamon** and others.

Select **Cinnamon** and login.

You should have a desktop of this type.
