10 Lesser Known Ubuntu One Features
================================================================================
Even though Ubuntu One may appear to be just an Ubuntu-only file synchronization service, it’s much more as it can be used on Windows, Android, iOS, and from the web. Ubuntu One has 5GB of free storage space for all.

As cited on howtogeek.com, Ubuntu One comes with features for sharing files or folders online, streaming music to your smartphone, synchronizing installed applications to all your devices, and much more. Let’s take a look at ten such unknown features below -

1.**Sync Any Folder** – On a default basis, Ubuntu merely synchronizes files within the Ubuntu One folder in your home directory. But you can right-click any folder, point to the Ubuntu One menu and choose Synchronize This Folder to begin synchronizing it, too. You can manage your synchronized folders from the Ubuntu One application.

2.**Limit Bandwidth** - Ubuntu One utilises every available bandwidth for file uploads and downloads as a default. It allows you to restrict its upload and download speeds in case you have a slow connection. The bandwidth settings can be seen on the Settings pane in the Ubuntu One window.

3.**Using Ubuntu One on Windows** - Ubuntu One doesn’t only run on Linux but provides a Windows client with complete file synchronisation support. Ubuntu One is a cross-platform file synchronization service and you can use it if you’re a Windows user who has never used Ubuntu.

4.**Sharing Files** – By making use of the right-click menu in your file manager or the Ubuntu One website, you can share files and folders publically on the Internet or privately with other Ubuntu One users.

5.**Synchronisation of Installed Software** - Ubuntu One can synchronize the software installed by you from Ubuntu’s Software Center between your computers making it easy to keep track of which software that has been installed.

6. **Using Mobile Apps** - Ubuntu One provides apps for Android, iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Using the app, you can access your Ubuntu One files on the go using your mobile device.

7.**Automatically Uploading Photos Via Your Smartphone** - The mobile app can automatically upload photos using your smartphone to your personal Ubuntu One cloud. It permits easy access to your photos on all your devices.

8.**Mobile Music Streaming** - Ubuntu One provides a Ubuntu One Music app for Android and iOS. This app permits you to stream your music to your mobile device from anywhere. You can also cache files on your device for offline listening.

9.**Sync Contacts** - Ubuntu One is able to synchronise your contacts and store them online. At the moment, you can import contacts from Facebook on the Ubuntu One website or add them manually. Earlier versions of Ubuntu could support contacts sync with the Evolution email client, but contact sync with Thunderbird is now absent in Ubuntu 12.04.

10.**Managing Files in Your Browser** - With Ubuntu One installed on your computer, you can access and take care of your files from the Ubuntu One website. You can download files, upload files, or manage your existing files using your browser.
