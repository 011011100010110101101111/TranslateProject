Interesting facts about Raspberry Pi
================================================================================
Raspberry Pi celebrated its second birthday last week. Since its debut on February 29, 2012, Raspberry Pi has ushered in a whole new generation of tiny, inexpensive, single-board computers. Numerous Raspberry Pi based DIY project ideas are popping up over the web, and there are many use cases of Raspberry Pi as low-cost learning media in the developing world. Celebrating its second birthday, I am going to share in this post several **interesting facts about Raspberry Pi**.

1. [100,000 Raspberry Pi boards][1] were sold on the first day of launch, and more than [2.5 million units][2] of them have been sold so far worldwide.

2. Initial batches of Raspberry Pi boards were made in Taiwan and China, but now all Raspberry Pi boards being sold are [manufactured in the UK][3].

3. Raspberry Pi is overclockable (by entering so-called [turbo mode][4]). You can change [overclocking/overvolting options][5] either at run-time with raspi-config tool, or at boot-time by editing boot-time parameters in /boot/config.txt. Changing overclocking/overvolting options does not void your warranty.

4. Raspberry Pi does not come with MPEG-2 decoder. Adding a blanket license for MPEG-2/VC-1 codecs to Raspberry Pi would [increase its board price by 10%][6]. Instead, you can [purchase MPEG-2/VC-1 license keys][7] only if you need to. Purchased licenses are tied to individual Raspberry Pi boards.

5. You [cannot run Windows 8][8] on Raspberry Pi (ARMv6) as Windows 8 requires an ARMv7 or higher processor. Likewise, you cannot run Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi as Ubuntu only supports [ARMv7 or higher][9].

6. [Origin][10] of the name Rapberry Pi: "Raspberry" originates from the fruit-based naming tradition for microcomputers in old days. "Pi" refers to "Python" because Python was one of the first programs ported to run on Raspberry Pi.

7. Raspberry in the [Raspberry Pi logo][11] is actually 3D [Buckminsterfullerene][12] (or bucky-ball) which has a total of 32 faces. 11 of them are visible in the logo. Co-incidentally, Raspberry Pi has a 32-bit ARM11 processor on board.

8. Methematica, a popular computational software program commercially available, [comes bundled for free][13] on Rapsberry Pi.

9. (thanks to garry grant) The biggest Kickstarter project which is based on Raspberry Pi is [Kano][14], where the goal is to delivery a computer/coding kit which can help people of all ages make a computer themselves. The project has garnered $1,522,160 from 13,387 backers.

10. According to [Rastrack.co.uk][15], the country where RaspberryPi is the most popular is UK.

That is all. If you know any interesting fact about Raspberry Pi, feel free to chime in.
