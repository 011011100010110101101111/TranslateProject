Canonical has announced a few days ago, in a security notice, that a new Linux kernel update is available for its Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx) operating system, fixing four vulnerabilities discovered in the Linux kernel packages by various developers. 

These are the four kernel vulnerabilities that affect the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx) distribution: CVE-2013-1060, CVE-2013-1943, CVE-2013-2206, and CVE-2013-4162.

You can click on each one to see how it affects your system, or go here for in-depth descriptions, as it affects other Linux operating systems as well.

The security flaws can be fixed if you upgrade your system(s) to the linux-image-2.6.32-51 (2.6.32-51.113) package(s). To apply the update, run the Update Manager application or follow these instructions: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades.

Don't forget to reboot your computer after the upgrade! We remind everyone that Ubuntu 12.10, Ubuntu 13.04 and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS also receive kernel updates.
