**Ubuntu PC makers System 76 have unveiled a new touchscreen notebook running Ubuntu 13.10. **

The Darter Ultra Thin features a 14.1-inch HD **multitouch display that works out of the box with Ubuntu**. It’s housed in a slender 0.9″ thick chassis weighing in at 4.60 lbs (around 2 kg). Battery life is estimated at around 5 hours – which, for Linux and its power management issues, is actually quite impressive!

Alongside the touchscreen the laptop also offers more traditional methods of input, namely a multi-touch trackpad and chiclet-style keyboard.
