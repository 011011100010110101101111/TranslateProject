**在谷歌输入‘Can Ubunt[u]’，一系列的自动建议会展现在你面前。这些建议都是根据最近搜索用户最频繁检索而形成的。

对于Linux老用户来说，他们都胸有成竹的回答这些问题。但是对于新用户或者那些还在探索类似Ubuntu是否是值得分配的人，他们不是十分清楚这些答案。这都是中肯，真实而且是基本的问题。 

所以，在这片文章，我将会去回答4个最常会被搜索到的"Can Ubuntu...?"问题。

### Ubuntu可以取代Windows吗？###

![Windows isn’t to everyones tastes — or needs](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/windows-9-desktop-rumour.png)
Windows 并不是每个人都喜欢 － 或者说是必须的。

是的。Ubutu（和其他Linux发行版）是可以安装到任何一台有能力运行微软系统的电脑。

无论你觉得 **应不应该** 取代它，不变的是，这取决于你自己的需求。

例如，你在上大学，所需的软件都只是Windows而已。暂时而言，你是不需要完全更换你的系统。对于工作也是同样的道理。如果你工作所用到的软件只是微软Office,  Adobe Creative Suite 或者是一个AutoCAD应用程序，不是很建议你更换系统，坚持你现在所用的软件就足够了。 

但是对于那些用Ubuntu完全取代微软的我们，Ubuntu 提供一个安全的桌面工作环境。这个桌面工作环境可以运行与支持很广的硬件环境。基本上，每个东西都软件的支持，从办公套件到网页浏览器，视频应用程序，音乐应用程序到游戏。 

### Can Ubuntu Run .exe Files? ###

You can run some Windows apps in Ubuntu

Yes, though not out of the box, and not with guaranteed success. This is because software distributed in .exe are meant to run on Windows. These are not natively compatible with any other desktop operating system, including Mac OS X or Android.

Software installers made for Ubuntu (and other Linux distributions) tend to come as ‘.deb’ files. These can be installed similarly to .exe — you just double-click and follow any on-screen prompts.

But Linux is versatile. Using a compatibility layer called ‘Wine’ (which technically is not an emulator, but for simplicity’s sake can be referred to as one for shorthand) that can run many popular apps. They won’t work quite as well as they do on Windows, nor look as pretty. But, for many, it works well enough to use on a daily basis.

Notable Windows software that can run on Ubuntu through Wine includes older versions of Photoshop and early versions of Microsoft Office . For a list of compatible software [refer to the Wine App Database][1].

### Can Ubuntu Get Viruses? ###

It may have errors, but it doesn’t have viruses

Theoretically, yes. But in reality, no.

Linux distributions are built in a way that makes it incredibly hard for viruses, malware and root kits to be installed, much less run and do any significant damage.

For example, most applications run as a ‘regular user’ with no special administrative privileges, required for a virus to access critical parts of the operating system. Most software is also installed from well maintained and centralised sources, like the Ubuntu Software Center, and not random websites. This makes the risk of installing something that is infected negligible.

Should you use anti-virus on Ubuntu? That’s up to you. For peace of mind, or if you’re regularly using Windows software through Wine or dual-booting, you can install a free and open-source virus scanner app like ClamAV, available from the Software Center.

You can learn more about the potential for viruses on Linux/Ubuntu [on the Ubuntu Wiki][2]. 

### Can Ubuntu Play Games? ###

![Steam has hundreds of high-quality games for Linux](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/steambeta.jpg)
Steam has hundreds of high-quality games for Linux

Oh yes it can. From the traditionally simple distractions of 2D chess, word games and minesweeper to modern AAA titles requiring powerful graphics cards, Ubuntu has a diverse range of games available for it.

Your first port of call will be the **Ubuntu Software Center**. Here you’ll find a sizeable number of free, open-source and paid-for games, including acclaimed indie titles like World of Goo and Braid, as well as several sections filled with more traditional offerings, like PyChess, four-in-a-row and Scrabble clones.

For serious gaming you’ll want to grab **Steam for Linux**. This is where you’ll find some of the latest and greatest games available, spanning the full gamut of genres.

Also keep an eye on the [Humble Bundle][3]. These ‘pay what you want’ packages are held for two weeks every month or so. The folks at Humble have been fantastic supporters of Linux as a gaming platform, single-handily ensuring the Linux debut of many touted titles.
