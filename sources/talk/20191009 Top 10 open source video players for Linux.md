_Choosing the right video player can help ensure that you get the optimum viewing experience, and give you the tools to [create a video website][3]. You can even allow you to customize the videos you are watching to your personal preferences too._

So to help enable you to pick the best player for your needs, we’ve curated a list of the top open source video players for Linux.

Let’s take a look:

  * It supports multiple formats such as MPEG-1,2,4, RealVideo, HVC, HEVC and so on



**2\. VLC Media Player**

This player was a no brainer for this list due to its impressive power and availability on a range of operating systems. It is written in C, C++ and Objective C and users can eliminate the need for figuring out plugins thanks to its extensive support of decoding libraries. The benefits of VLC Media Player include:

  * Provides support for DVD players on Linux

This cross-platform media player, written only using Qt library in C++ is a powerful, multi-functional player. We like it because:

  * Supportive of EDL files, and you can configure subtitles fetched from the Internet
  * A variety of Skins that can be downloaded from the Internet
  * Multiple speed playback

**8\. Gnome Videos**

Previously called Totem, for those with Gnome desktop environments, this is the player of choice.
Written purely in C this was built by using GStreamer multimedia framework for playback, and the other version (&gt; 2.7.1) was then configured using xine libraries as a backend. It’s great because:

It has an impressive ability to support numerous formats including:

  * SHOUTcast, SMIL, M3U, Windows Media Player format and more
  * You can adjust light settings such as brightness and contrast during playback
  * Loads SubRip subtitles
  * Supports for direct video playback from Internet channels such as Apple



**9\. Xine Multimedia Player**

  * It supports physical media as well as Video Devices. Think 3gp, Matroska, MOV, Mp4, Audio formats,
  * Network Protocols, V4L, DVB, and PVR to name but a few
  * It can correct the synchronization of audio and video streams manually
