Java vs. Python: Which should you choose?
======
Compare the two most popular programming languages in the world, and let
us know which one you prefer in our poll.
![Developing code.][1]

Let's compare the two most popular and powerful programming languages in the world: Java and Python! Both languages have huge community support and libraries to perform almost any programming task, although selecting a programming language usually depends on the developer's use case. After you compare and contrast, please make sure to answer our poll to [share your opinion][2] on which is best.

### What is it?

  * **Java** is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language used mostly for developing a wide range of applications from mobile to web to enterprise apps.
  * **Python** is a high-level object-oriented programming language used mostly for web development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and other data science applications.



### Creator

  * **Java** was created by James Gosling (Sun Microsystems).
  * **Python** was created by Guido van Rossum.



### Open source status

  * **Java** is free and (mostly) open source except for corporate use.
  * **Python** is free and open source for all use cases.



### Platform dependencies

  * **Java** is platform-independent (although JVM isn't) per its WORA ("write once, run anywhere") philosophy.
  * **Python** is platform-dependent.



### Compiled or interpreted

  * **Java** is a compiled language. Java programs are translated to byte code at compile time and not runtime.
  * **Python** is an interpreted language. Python programs are translated at runtime.



### File creation

  * **Java**: After compilation, **&lt;filename&gt;.class** is generated.
  * **Python**: During runtime, **&lt;filename&gt;.pyc** is created.



### Errors types

  * **Java** has ****2 ****types of errors: compile and runtime errors.
  * **Python** has 1 error type: traceback (or runtime) error.



### Statically or dynamically typed

  * **Java** is statically typed. When initiating variables, their types need to be specified in the program because type checking is done at compile time.
  * **Python** is dynamically typed. Variables don't need to have a type specified when initiated because type checking is done at runtime.



### Syntax

  * **Java**: Every statement needs to end with a semicolon ( **;** ), and blocks of code are separated by curly braces ( **{}** ).
  * **Python**: Blocks of code are separated by indentation (the user can choose how many white spaces to use, but it should be consistent throughout the block).



### Number of classes

  * **Java**: Only one public top-level class can exist in a single file in Java.
  * **Python**: Any number of classes can exist in a single file in Python.



### More or less code?

  * **Java** generally involves writing more lines of code compared to Python.
  * **Python** involves writing fewer lines of code compared to Java.



### Multiple inheritance

  * **Java** does not support multiple inheritance (inheriting from two or more base classes)
  * **Python** supports multiple inheritance although it is rarely implemented due to various issues like inheritance complexity, hierarchy, dependency issues, etc.



### Multi-threading

  * **Java** multi-threading can support two or more concurrent threads running at the same time.
  * **Python** uses a global interpreter lock (GIL), allowing only a single thread (CPU core) to run at a time.



### Execution speed

  * **Java** is usually faster in execution time than Python.
  * **Python** is usually slower in execution time than Java.



### Hello world in Java


```
public class Hello {
   public static void main([String][3][] args) {
      [System][4].out.println("Hello Opensource.com from Java!");
   }
}
```

### Hello world in Python


```
`print("Hello Opensource.com from Java!")`
```

### Run the programs

![Java vs. Python][5]

To run the java program "Hello.java" you need to compile it first which creates a "Hello.class" file. To run just the class name, use "java Hello." For Python, you would just run the file "python3 helloworld.py."
