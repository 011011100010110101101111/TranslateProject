The game was released on October 2, 2000 by Jasmin Patry, a student studying at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.  An original Linux game, it is a very fun and simple racing game, without any complexity or violence, which makes it suitable for all age groups.

Sliding on snow allows more manoeuvrability, sliding on ice makes Tux go faster and sliding on rocky patches slows down Tux.
