Torvalds: 'People who start writing kernel code get hired really quickly'
================================================================================
Torvalds: 参加linux内核贡献更加容易找工作
========================================

Now more than ever, the development of the Linux kernel is a matter for the professionals, as unpaid volunteer contributions to the project reached their lowest recorded levels in the latest "Who Writes Linux" report, which was released today.

相比起以往，linux内核的发展变是一个专业性的问题，作为一个无偿贡献者去贡献的项目今天在"谁写linux"被低调报道出来了。

According to the report, which is compiled by the Linux Foundation, just 11.8 percent of kernel development last year was done by unpaid volunteers -- a 19 percent downturn from the 2012 figure of 14.6 percent. The foundation says that the downward trend in volunteer contributions has been present for years.

这个报道由linux基金会编写，基金会说自愿者有逐年下降的趋势，上年有11.8%的内核开发是由无偿自愿者完成，从2012年起由14.6%下滑了19%。

Even so, unpaid contributors were still the single biggest source of commits in the latest Who Writes Linux, at 11,968 total changes -- good for 12.4 percent of the whole. However, corporate contributors collectively account for much, much more. The Linux Foundation said that more than 80 percent of all work on the kernel is done by paid professional developers.
即使是这样，在最新的谁写linux里面报道，无偿贡献者还是主要的共享来源，共有11,968改变，整体来说有12.4%是好的，企业贡献者共同占比越来越多，有超过80%的内核贡献是有有尝的专业开发者来完成，linux基金会说。

According to Linus Torvalds, the shift towards paid developers hasn't changed much about kernel development on its own.

根据 linus Torvalds 说，这个有偿开发者趋势不会改变太多这个内核发展的本身。

"I think one reason it hasn't changed things all that much is that it's not so much 'unpaid volunteers are going away' as 'people who start writing kernel code get hired really quickly,'" he told Network World.

他向全世界人说，我认为不会改变太多的一个原因是不会有更多的无偿自愿者因为编写内核就会更加快找到工作而离开。

Torvalds said that, while Linux development has changed for plenty of other reasons -- and that, naturally, new contributors pop up all the time -- many of the original developers, with decades of experience, have simply been snapped up by companies with an interest in Linux.

讲到，linux发展改变有很多其他原因，很自然的，新的贡献者会经常冒出来，有很多都是原来的开发者，有着10年的经验，被很多对linux感兴趣的公司抢着去做。

"We may have started as volunteers, but we're happily employed doing Linux these days," he said.

他说：“开始我们是自愿者，但我们这几天很开心被请去开发linux”

Torvalds' own role in development has become increasingly hands-off, according to the report -- he has personally signed off on 329 patches since version 3.10 of kernel was released, or 0.4 percent. Increasingly, subsystem maintainers do their own reviews and merges of code.

Torvalds 开始抽离了他的开发角色，根据报道在3.10的内核版本里面他个人发布329补丁,占04% 逐渐地，子系统维护人员自己会检查与合并他们的代码。
