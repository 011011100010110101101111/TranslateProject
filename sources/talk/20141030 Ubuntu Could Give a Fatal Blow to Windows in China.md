Ubuntu Could Give a Fatal Blow to Windows in China
================================================================================
> Ubuntu Kylin might be able to replace Windows in China

**The Windows operating systems is going out the front door in China and its place will be taken by a Linux distribution that will be used by the authorities and the governing body. The problem is that there is no real alternative, although at least one OS might be ready for the task, and that is Ubuntu Kylin.**

The Chinese government and Microsoft now have a rocky relationship, to say the least. [As detailed in today's news][1], a plan to replace Windows gradually throughout the country with a Linux counterpart is in the works. It's unclear what system will be used to take over, especially since this a very complex situation and a very big country.

Usually, there is no size-fits-all solution to this kind of problem and the Chinese approach does seem to be a little too blunt. In any case, this opens up a great window of opportunity for Ubuntu Kylin, a distribution based on Ubuntu and developed by Chinese devs and Canonical. It's been stable for quite some time and they already had a few consecutive launches.

### Ubuntu Kylin is knocking on Windows' door ###

It's interesting to see that in the same day that this piece of news about the Chinese intentions surfaces, an interview with Dr. Jonas Zhang, vice professor of the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), about the [recent launch of the 14.10 branch][2] has been published.

"In our 14.10 release, there are some sweet new features. For example, beginners can find a replacement of Windows software via Ubuntu Kylin Software Center easily; users can login to Ubuntu Kylin applications and community via the SSO of Ubuntu Kylin (Single Sign-On System of Ubuntu Kylin, we call it UKID); Sogou IM (one of the most famous Chinese input method in the world, which has been launched on Apple’s App Store since last month) reduces 40% of the CPU and memory usage."

"More than 50 project managers, engineers and community managers from CSIP (one service agency of China government), Canonical and NUDT (National University of Defense Technology) are working on Ubuntu Kylin. Most of the full-time engineers are from NUDT. Many developers from Ubuntu, Debian and other communities also take part in the development of Ubuntu Kylin," [said][2] Dr. Jonas Zhang.

The Chinese government might be looking to build yet another Linux distro by itself (not their first attempt), but it looks like they could already have a very good candidate to take over Windows. This would also be very good business for Canonical, at least in terms of recognition. 

If Ubuntu, through its Kylin connection, manages to replace Windows in a country as big as China, it would be a huge boost for the company. It remains to be seen if the developers' efforts to make Ubuntu Kylin a competitive OS were not in vain.
