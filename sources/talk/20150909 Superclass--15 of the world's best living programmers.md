It seems like there are lots of programmers out there these days, and lots of really good programmers. But which one is the very best?

Even though there’s no way to really say who the best living programmer is, that hasn’t stopped developers from frequently kicking the topic around. ITworld has solicited input and scoured coder discussion forums to see if there was any consensus. As it turned out, a handful of names did frequently get mentioned in these discussions.

Use the arrows above to read about 15 people commonly cited as the world’s best living programmer.

### Margaret Hamilton ###

**Main claim to fame: The brains behind Apollo’s flight control software**

Credentials: As the Director of the Software Engineering Division at Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, she headed up the team which [designed and built][3] the on-board [flight control software for NASA’s Apollo][4] and Skylab missions. Based on her Apollo work, she later developed the [Universal Systems Language][5] and [Development Before the Fact][6] paradigm. Pioneered the concepts of [asynchronous software, priority scheduling, and ultra-reliable software design][7]. Coined the term “[software engineering][8].” Winner of the [Augusta Ada Lovelace Award][9] in 1986 and [NASA’s Exceptional Space Act Award in 2003][10].

Quotes: “Hamilton invented testing , she pretty much formalised Computer Engineering in the US.” [ford_beeblebrox][11]

“I think before her (and without disrespect including Knuth) computer programming was (and to an extent remains) a branch of mathematics. However a flight control system for a spacecraft clearly moves programming into a different paradigm.” [Dan Allen][12]

“... she originated the term ‘software engineering’ — and offered a great example of how to do it.” [David Hamilton][13]

“What a badass” [Drukered][14]
