================================================================================
![NoSQL Databases, Java, Terrastore, Neo4j, Voldemort, HBase, InfoGrid, HyperGraphDB, Perst, NeoDatis ODB](http://www.efytimes.com/admin/useradmin/photo/R6eL24207PM5202014.jpg)

NoSQL is picking up. Many enterprises and developers have already replaced their MySQL databases with the NoSQL version. NoSQL makes it easier to analyse unstructured data, as such developers must be aware of the latest trends and tools that exist in the world of NoSQL.

#### 1.[Terrastore][1] ####

Modern document store which provides advanced scalability and elasticity features without sacrificing consistency. Terrastore is based on Terracotta, so it relies on an industry-proven, fast (and cool) clustering technology.

#### 2.[Neo4j][2] ####

Open-source graph database, implemented in Java. The developers describe Neo4j as "embedded, disk-based, fully transactional Java persistence engine that stores data structured in graphs rather than in tables".

#### 3.[Voldemort][3] ####

Distributed key-value storage system. It is basically just a big, distributed, persistent, fault-tolerant hash table. For applications that can use an O/R mapper like active-record or hibernate this will provide horizontal scalability and much higher availability but at great loss of convenience.

#### 4.[HBase][4] ####

Apache HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational database modeled after Google's Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data by Chang et al.

#### 5.[InfoGrid][5] ####

Web Graph Database with a many additional software components that make the development of REST-ful web applications on a graph foundation easy.

#### 6.[HyperGraphDB][6] ####

General purpose, extensible, portable, distributed, embeddable, open-source data storage mechanism. It is a graph database designed specifically for artificial intelligence and semantic web projects, it can also be used as an embedded object-oriented database for projects of all sizes.

#### 7.[Perst][7] ####

Perst is McObject's open source, dual license, object-oriented embedded database system (ODBMS). It is available in one edition developed as an all-Java embedded database, and another implemented in C# (for Microsoft .NET Framework applications).

#### 8.[NeoDatis ODB][8] ####

Simple Object Database that currently runs on the Java, .Net, Google Android, Groovy and Scala.
