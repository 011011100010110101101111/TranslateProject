================================================================================

[Sublime Text][1] is one of the best (if not best) text editor for programmers. Packed with numerous feature and great looking interface, Sublime is available for all three major desktop OS i.e. Windows, Mac and Linux.

But it is not that Sublime Text is perfect. There are bugs, crashes and almost no support. If you have been following Sublime Text development, you know that the beta version of Sublime Text has been out for more than a year now and there is no clear communication to users about its release date. And above all, Sublime Text is neither free nor [Open Source][2].

All these issues also frustrated [Fredrik Ehnbom][3] and hence he started an Open Source project, [Lime Text][4], on [Github][5] to make a new text editor which looks and works exactly the same way as Sublime Text. On the question of why he decided to “clone” an existing text editor, Frederic mentions:

> As none of the other text editors I’ve tried come close to the love I had for Sublime Text, I decided I had to create my own.

Lime Text is built in Go for backend while the frontend is in ermbox, Qt (QML) and HTML/JavaScript. The development is in progress with clear [goals][6] in sight. You can contribute to the project on its [Github page][7].

If you want to try the beta version, you can build Lime Text by following the instructions on the [wiki][8]. Meanwhile, if you are looking for other powerful text editors, give [SciTE][9] a go.
