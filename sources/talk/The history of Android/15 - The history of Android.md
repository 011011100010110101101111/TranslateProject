安卓2.3最重要的新增功能就是系统全局文本选择界面，你可以在左侧截图的谷歌搜索栏看到它。长按一个词能使其变为橙色高亮，并且出现可拖拽的小标签，长按高亮部分会弹出剪切，复制和粘贴选项。之前的方法使用的是依赖于十字方向键的控制，但现在有了触摸文本选择，Nexus S不再需要额外的硬件控件。

左侧截图右半边展示的是新的复选框设计和边界回弹效果。冻酸奶（2.2）的复选框像个灯泡——选中时显示一个绿色的勾，未选中的时候显示灰色的勾。姜饼在选项关闭的时候显示一个空的选框——这显得更有意义。姜饼是第一个拥有滚动到底发光效果的版本。当到达列表底部的时候会有一道橙色的光晕，你越往上拉光晕越明显。列表上拉滚动反弹也许最直观，但那是苹果的专利。

姜饼里的拨号受到了稍微多点的照顾。它变得更暗了，并且谷歌终于解决了原本的直角，圆角以及圆形的结合问题。现在所有的边角都是直角了。所有的拨号按键被替换成了带有奇怪下划线的样式，像是用边角料拼凑的。你永远无法确定是否看到了一个按钮——我们的大脑得想象出按钮形状的剩余部分。

图中的无线网络对话框可以看作是剩下的系统全局改动的样本。所有的对话框标题从灰色变为黑色，对话框，下拉框以及按钮边缘都变成了直角，各部分色调都变暗了一点。所有的这些全局变化使得姜饼看起来不像原来那样活泼，而是更加地成熟。“到处都是黑色”的外观必然不是最受欢迎的色调，但它无疑看起来比安卓之前的灰色和米色的配色方案好多了。

新版系统带来了“安卓市场2.0”，虽然它不是姜饼独占的。主要的列表设计和原来一致，但谷歌将屏幕上部三分之一覆盖上了大块的绿色横幅，用来展示热门应用以及导航。这里主要的设计灵感也许是绿色的安卓吉祥物——它们的颜色完美匹配。在系统设计偏向暗色系的时候，霓虹灯般的绿色横幅和白色列表让市场明快得多。

但是，相同的绿色背景图片被用在不同的手机上，这意味着在低分辨率设备上，绿色横幅看起来更加的大。不少用户抱怨这浪费了屏幕空间，于是随后的更新使得绿色横幅跟随内容向上滚动。在那时，横屏模式更加糟糕——绿色横幅会填满剩下的半个屏幕。

应用详情页面经过重新设计有了可折叠部分。文本描述只截取前几行展示，向下滑动页面不用再穿过数千行的描述。简短的描述后有一个“更多”按钮可供点击来显示完整的描述。这让用户可以轻松地滑动过列表找到像是截图和“联系开发者”，这些部分通常在页面偏下部分。

The other parts of the Android homescreen wisely toned down the green monster. The rest of the app was mostly just the old Market with new green navigational elements. Any of the old tabbed interfaces were upgraded to swipeable tabs. In the right Gingerbread image, swiping right-to-left would switch from "Top Paid" to "Top Free," which made navigation a little easier.

Gingerbread came with the first of what would become the Google Play content stores: Google Books. The app was a basic book reader that would display books in a simple thumbnail grid. The "Get eBooks" link at the top of the screen opened the browser and loaded a mobile website where you could buy books.

Google Books and the “My Apps" page of the Market were both examples of early precursors to the Action Bar. Just like the current guidelines, a stickied top bar featured the app icon, the name of the screen within the app, and a few controls. The layout of these two apps was actually pretty modern looking.

Google Maps (which, again, at this point was on the Android Market and not exclusive to this version of Android) now featured another action bar precursor in the form of a top-aligned control bar. This version of an early action bar featured a lot of experimenting. The majority of the bar was taken up with a search box, but you could never type into the bar. Tapping on it would open the old search interface from Android 1.x, with a totally different bar design and bubbly buttons. This 2.3 bar wasn't anything more than a really big search button.

Along with Places' new top billing in the app drawer came a redesigned interface. Unlike the rest of Gingerbread, this switched from black to white. Google also kept the old buttons with rounded corners. This new version of Maps helpfully displayed the hours of operation of a business, and it offered advanced search options like places that were currently open or thresholds for ratings and price. Reviews were brought to the surface, allowing a user to easily get a feel for the current business. It was now also possible to "star" a location from the search results and save it for later.

The YouTube app seemed completely separate from the rest of Android, as if whoever designed this had no idea what Gingerbread would end up looking like. Highlights were red and gray instead of green and orange, and rather than the flat black of Gingerbread, YouTube featured bubbly buttons, tabs, and bars with rounded corners and heavy gradients. The new app did get a few things right, though. All the tabs could be horizontally swiped through, and the app finally added a vertical viewing mode for videos. Android seemed like such an uncoordinated effort at this stage. It’s like someone told the YouTube team “make it black," and that was all the direction they were given. The only Android entity this seemed to match was the old Google Maps business page design.

Despite the weird design choices, the YouTube app had the best approximation yet of an action bar. Besides the bar at the top with an app logo and a few buttons, the rightmost button was labeled “more" and would bring up options that didn’t fit in the bar. Today, this is called the “Overflow" button, and it's a standard UI piece.

One last update for Gingerbread came with Android 2.3.4, which brought a new version of Google Talk. Unlike the Nexus One, the Nexus S had a front-facing camera—and the redesigned version of Google Talk had voice and video calling. The colored indicators on the right of the friends list were used to indicate not only presence, but voice and video availability. A dot was text only, a microphone was text or voice, and a camera was text, voice, or video. If available, tapping on a voice or video icon would immediately start a call with that person.

Gingerbread is the oldest version of Android still supported by Google. Firing up a Gingerbread device and letting it sit for a few minutes will result in a ton of upgrades. Gingerbread will pull down Google Play Services, resulting in a ton of new API support, and it will upgrade to the very newest version of the Play Store. Open the Play Store and hit the update button, and just about every single Google app will be replaced with a modern version. We tried to keep this article authentic to the time Gingerbread was released, but a real user stuck on Gingerbread today will be treated to a flood of anachronisms.

Gingerbread is still supported because there are a good number of users still running the now ancient OS. Gingerbread's staying power is due to the extremely low system requirements, making it the go-to choice for slow, cheap phones. The next few versions of Android were much more exclusive and/or demanding on hardware. For instance, Android 3.0 Honeycomb is not open source, meaning it could only be ported to a device with Google's cooperation. It was also only for tablets, making Gingerbread the newest phone version of Android for a very long time. 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich was the next phone release, but it significantly raised Android’s systems requirements, cutting off the low-end of the market. Google is hoping to get cheaper phones back on the update track with 4.4 KitKat, which brings the system requirements back down to 512MB of RAM. The passage of time helps, too—by now, even cheap SoCs have caught up to the demands of a 4.0-era version of Android.
