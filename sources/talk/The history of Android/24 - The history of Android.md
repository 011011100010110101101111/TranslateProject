在 I/O 大会推出的另一个应用更新是 Google Music 应用。音乐应用经过了完全的重新设计，最终摆脱了蜂巢中引入的蓝底蓝色调的设计。Play Music 的设计和几个月前发布的 Play 商店一致，有着响应式的白色卡片布局。Music 同时还是最早采用新抽屉导航样式的主要应用之一。谷歌还随新应用发布了 Google Play Music All Access，每月 10 美元的包月音乐订阅服务。Google Music 现在拥有订阅计划，音乐购买，以及云端音乐存储空间。这个版本还引入了“Instant Mix”，谷歌会在云端给相似的歌曲计算出一份歌单。

谷歌还引入了“Google Play Games”，一个后端服务，开发者可以将其附加到游戏中。这项服务简单说就是安卓版的 Xbox Live 或苹果的 Game Center。开发者可以给游戏添加 Play Games 支持，这样就能通过使用谷歌的后端服务，更简单地集成成就，多人游戏，游戏匹配，用户账户以及云端存档到游戏中。

Play Games 是谷歌在游戏方面推进的开始。就像单独的 GPS 设备，翻盖手机，以及 MP3 播放器，智能手机的生产者希望游戏设备能够变成智能手机的一个功能点。当你有部智能手机的时候你为什么还有买个任天堂 DS 或 PS Vita 呢？一个易于使用的多人游戏服务是这项计划的重要部分，我们仍能看到这个决定最后的成果。在今天，坊间都在传言谷歌和苹果有关于客厅游戏设备的计划。

毫无疑问一些产品为了赶上 Google I/O 大会的发布准时开发完成了，[但是三个半小时内的主题][1]已经够多了，一些产品在大会的发布上忽略了。Google I/O 大会的三天后一切都清楚了，谷歌带来了 Google Keep，一个用于安卓和在线的笔记应用。Keep 看起来很简单，就是一个用上了响应式 Google-Now 风格设计的笔记应用。用户可以改变卡片的尺寸，从多栏布局改为单列视图。笔记可以由文本，清单，自动转文本的语音或者图片组成。笔记卡片可以拖动并在主界面重新组织，你甚至可以给笔记换个颜色。

在 I/O 大会之后，没有哪些应用不在谷歌的周期外更新里。2013 年 6 月，谷歌发布了新版设计的 Gmail。最显眼的变化就是一个月前 Google I/O 大会引入的新导航抽屉界面。最吸引眼球的变化是用上了 Google+ 资料图片来取代复选框。虽然复选框看起来被去掉了，它们其实还在那，点击邮件左边的图片就是了。

One month later, Google released a completely overhauled version of Google Maps to the Play Store. It was the first ground-up redesign of Google Maps since Ice Cream Sandwich. The new version fully adopted the Google Now white card aesthetic, and it greatly reduced the amount of stuff on the screen. The new Google Maps seemed to have a design mandate to always show a map on the screen somewhere, as you’ll be hard pressed to find something other than the settings that fully covers the map.

This version of Google Maps seemed to live in its own little design world. The white search bar “floated" above the map, with maps showing on the sides and top of the bar. That didn't really make it seem like the traditional Action Bar design. The navigation drawer, in the top left on every other app, was in the bottom left. There was no up button, app icon, or overflow button on the main screen.

The left picture shows what popped up when you tapped on the search bar (along with the keyboard, which had been closed). In the past, Google would show an empty page below a blank search bar, but in Maps, Google used that space to link to the new “Local" page. The “blank" search results displayed links to common, browsable results like restaurant listings, gas stations, and attractions. At the bottom of the results page was a list of nearby results from your search history and an option to manually cache parts of the map.

The right set of images shows location page. The map shown in the top of the Maps 7 screenshot isn’t a thumbnail; that’s the full map view. In the new version of Google Maps, a location was displayed as a card that “floats" overtop of the main map, and the map was repositioned to center on the location. Scrolling up would move the card up and cover the map, and scrolling down would show the whole map with the result reduced to a small strip at the bottom. If the location was part of a list of search results, swiping left and right would move through the results.

The location pages were redesigned to be much more useful at a glance. On the first page, the new version added critical information, like the location on a map, the review score, and the number of reviews. Since this is a phone, and the software will be dialing for you, the phone number was deemed pointless and was removed. The old version showed the distance to the location in miles, while the new version of Google Maps showed the distance in terms of time, based on traffic and preferred mode of transportation—a much more useful metric. The new version also put a share button front and center, which made coordination over IM or text messaging a lot easier.

### Android 4.3, Jelly Bean—getting wearable support out early ###

Android 4.3 would have been an incredible update if Google had done the traditional thing and not released updates between 4.3 and 4.2 through the Play Store. If the new Play Store, Gmail, Maps, Books, Music, Hangouts, Keep, and Play Games were bundled into a big brick as a new version of Android, it would have been hailed as the biggest release ever. Google didn't need to do hold back features anymore though. With very little left that required an OS update, at the end of July 2013, Google released the seemingly insignificant update called "Android 4.3."

Google made no qualms about the low importance of 4.3, calling the newest release "Jelly Bean" (the third one in a row). Android 4.3's feature list read like a laundry list of things Google couldn't update from the Play Store or through Google Play Services, mostly consisting of low-level framework changes for developers.

Many of the additions seemed to fit a singular purpose, though—Android 4.3 was Google's trojan horse for wearable computing support. 4.3 added support for Bluetooth Low Energy, a way to wirelessly connect Android to another device and pass data back and forth while using a very small amount of power—an integral feature to a wearable device. Android 4.3 also added a "Notification Access" API, which allowed apps to completely replicate and control the notification panel. Apps could display notification text and pictures and interact with the notification the same way users do—namely pressing action buttons and dismissing notifications. Doing this from an on-board app when you have the notification panel is useless, but on a device that is separate from your phone, replicating the information in the notification panel becomes much more useful. One of the few apps that plugged into this was "Android Wear Preview," which used the notification API to power most of the interface for Android Wear.

The "4.3 is for wearables" theory explained the relatively low number of features in 4.3: it was pushed out the door to give OEMs time to update devices in time for the launch of [Android Wear][2]. The plan seems to have worked. Android Wear requires Android 4.3 and up, which has been out for so long now that most major flagships have updated.

Android 4.3 was not all that exciting, but Android releases from here on out didn't need to be all that exciting. Everything became so modularized that Google could push updates out as soon as they were done through Google Play, rather than drop everything in one huge brick as an OS update.
