When I last wrote about [reasons to switch to Linux][1], a reader suggested me to write about Linux alternatives of popular Windows applications. After all it is one of the most common concern among Windows users thinking to switch to Linux.

In an effort to address the same concern, in this article, I have listed photo related applications that could be used for various purposes. It’s not really alternatives to Windows programs but rather a collection of **image related applications in Linux** that could be used for various purposes.

### Image editing applications in Linux ###

When I say image editing, I mean hardcore professional style photo editing. In other words I am talking about [Photoshop][2]. When it comes to Linux alternative to Adobe Photoshop, there is only one name that comes to mind: [GIMP][3]. GIMP is a cross platform, full featured, professional grade image editing application that comes with almost all the features as Photoshop. Unlike Photoshop, GIMP is free in all platforms such as Linux, Windows, OS X etc.

You can install GIMP is Ubuntu from Ubuntu Software Center.

If you are Photoshop addict and have difficulties in adjusting to looks and shortcuts of GIMP, I would recommend [Gimpshop][4]. It’s basically GIMP but made to feel and look like Photoshop. And it’s free as well.

### Photo management applications in Linux ###

I am talking about applications that handle image library. You can view your images, import them from camera and phones, edit them a little, share them etc. In Windows, we have Windows Photo Viewer. In Linux, [Shotwell][5] is the most popular photo management these days. It is the default applications in various Linux distributions, Ubuntu being one of them. Unlike GIMP, Shotwell is lightweight but offers very basic editing features.

One good alternative to Shotwell is [gThumb][6].

### Applications to handle raw camera images in Linux ###

As the price of DSLRs decreases, number of (amateur) photographer increases in same proportion. As many DSLRs use RAW format to save the images, default image viewers like Shotwell won’t be able to handle these images. This is where application like [digiKam][7] comes in picture. An Open Source software, digiKam lets you handle your high end camera images in a professional manner. You can view, manage, edit, enhance, organize, tag, and share photographs with digiKam.

Another alternative to digiKam is [GTKRawGallery][8] which also focuses on handling camera images.

### Paint applications in Linux ###

If you are looking for Linux alternatives to Microsoft [Paint][9], my first choice is Pinta. You can do a little editing such as annotate with text, draw circles etc. You can draw images with pencil, brush and spray. In Ubuntu, Pinta can be installed from Ubuntu Software Center.

Another alternative to Pinta is [Krita][10] which is more powerful and provides more features. Better than a paint app but not as good as GIMP.

### Instagram like applications in Linux ###

In the end, lets talk about beautifying your images. We have numerous retro image effects apps on mobile devices but that’s not the case with desktop. To apply Instagram like effects in Linux, I know only [XnRetro][11] which does the work in a neat way. I recommend reading this article to know more about [how to use XnRetro in Ubuntu][12].

That compiles the list of various type of image applications available in Ubuntu and other Linux distributions. It’s not that this is the complete list of such apps. In fact there are many more. I have just listed the best in each category.

What you think? Do you use some other application for a particular purpose? Do share your views with us.
