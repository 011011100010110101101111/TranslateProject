**看来Linux在2014年有很多改变，许多用户都表示今年Linux的确有进步，但是仅凭这个就能断定2014年就是"Linux桌面年"吗？**

"Linux桌面年"这句话，在过去几年就被传诵得像句颂歌一样，可以说是在试图用一种比较有意义的方式来标记它的发展进程。此类事情目前还没有发生过，在我们的见证下也从无先例，所以这就不难理解为什么Linux用户会用这个角度去看待这句话。

大多数软件和硬件领域不太会通过这种快速Most software and hardware domains don't usually go through this kind of fast progress and things happen at a slower pace, but things have been wild even for people who have a better insight into the industry. It's hard, if not impossible, to pinpoint a certain moment or a certain event, but Linux development exploded and changed exponentially in the course of just a couple of years.

### Linux桌面年这句话不可轻言 ###

没有一个比较权威的人和机构能判定Linux桌面年已经到来或者已经过去，所以我们只能尝试根据迄今为止我们所看到的和用户所反映的去推断。有一些人比较保守，改变对他们影响不大，还有一些人则比较激进，永远不知满足。这真的要取决于你的见解了。

The spark that seems to have put everything in motion appears to be the launch of Steam for Linux, although we've seen some important movement of the Linux gaming scene before that became a reality. In any case, Valve is probably the catalyst of the resurgence of what we're seeing today.

The Linux desktop has been in a kind of slow evolution in the past decade and nothing really changed. There have been a lot of innovations for sure, but the market share has remained almost the same. No matter how cool the desktop became or how many features Linux had well before anyone else, things have remained largely the same, and that includes the participation of companies making proprietary software. They largely ignored Linux.

Now, more companies have shown interest in the Linux platform in the past year than they did in the last 10. Maybe it's a natural evolution and Valve had nothing to do with it, but Linux has finally reached a level where it can be used and understood by regular users, not just people fascinated by open source.

The drivers are better, game studios are porting games now on a regular basis, applications and middleware that we never thought we would see on Linux have started to show up, the Linux kernel development has an incredible pace, the installation process for most of the major distros is usually trivial, and all of these are just the tip of the iceberg.

所以，当有人问你2014年是不是Linux桌面年时，你可以说“是的！”，因为Linux桌面完全统治了2014年。
