IDG News Service - As organizations move in-house systems to the cloud, Canonical wants them to consider switching their OSes as well.

IDG新闻服务 - 因为各机构将内部开发的系统移动到了云端，Canonical公司想要他们考虑将桌面操作系统也切换了。

"When people move to cloud, it very often involves re-architecting an application," said Mark Baker, Canonical Ubuntu Server product manager. "Enterprises are evolving to want to take advantage of scale-out and cloud technology."

Canonical公司的Ubuntu Server产品经理Mark Baker说：“当人们移动到云端时，它往往涉及到重新设计应用程序，众多企业都想要从横向扩展和云技术中获利。”

Due to factors such as the emergence of cloud services, about 70 percent of CIOs plan to revaluate their choices in IT vendors within the next few years, [according to a Gartner survey][1]. "We are seeing evidence of that," Baker said.

鉴于一些类似于云服务的急切因素，在未来几年内，约百分之70的CIO打算重新评估他们在IT供应商的选择，[根据Gartner的调查][1].Baker说：“我们看到这方面的证据。”

With Thursday's release of the server edition of its Linux distribution, Ubuntu 14.04, Canonical will emphasize how it can be used for organizations as the base for running large mission-critical applications in hosted environments. The release comes with long-term support and many cloud-friendly software programs, such as Docker and the latest edition of OpenStack.

星期四发布的Linux发行版本，服务器版Ubuntu 14.04，Canonical公司强调了在宿主环境中，机构是如何运用它来作为运行大型关键任务应用程序的基础。这个版本带有长期支持和许多云友好的软件程序，如Docker，最新版本的OpenStack。

> "We are now much more conscious of the fact that we are creating a platform that is being adopted by enterprises," Baker said.
> 

> Baker说：“我们现在更加意识到我们正在创造一个企业采用的平台”

> Ubuntu 14.04 is a long-term support (LTS) release, meaning it will come with five years of patching and support, making it more viable for enterprise and long-term production usage. It will also allow users to update software packages from Ubuntu's own repository system for this time as well.

> Ubuntu 14.04 是一个长期支持版本(LTS)，意味着它将会有五年的补丁和支持，这使得它作为企业长期的生产应用更可行。这次它也将允许用户从Ubuntu自身的版本库系统更新软件包。

> Canonical releases a new version of Ubuntu twice a year, though LTS releases only come every two years. The other non-LTS releases are only supported for nine months.
> 

> Canonical公司每年发布两个新的Ubuntu版本，但是每两年发布一个LTS版本，其他非LTS版本只支持九个月。

> With regular non-LTS releases, users will no longer get bug fixes and they cannot update software or the OS itself through Canonical after nine months. This gives users only about three months to update the OS, should they choose to do so.
>
>使用常规非LTS版本，九个月后，用户将不再得到bug修复，无法从Canonical那儿更新软件或操作系统。如果用户选择这样做，那他们只有约三个月来更新系统。
> 
> Long-term support comes at a good time, given the increasing severity of bugs being found in the infrastructure software, such as the severe OpenSSL Heartbleed bug [that rendered countless Web applications vulnerable to attack][2].
>
>长期支持来的正是时候，他将找出日益严重的基础软件安全漏洞，如OpenSSL的“心脏出血”安全漏洞[这使无数的Web应用程序容易受到攻击][2].

Also last week, Microsoft discontinued support for its Windows XP OS, potentially leaving millions of users [open to attack][3].

上周，微软停止支持Windows XP操作系统，可能会使数以百万计的用户[遭受攻击][3].

About 70 percent of those using the server edition of Ubuntu use the LTS versions of the OS, Baker noted.

Baker说，使用Ubuntu服务器版操作系统的人中大约有百分之70使用LTS版本。

Organizations "don't want to be pushed to upgrade until a time that suits them. Five years is a long time. It gives them a lot of runway to work out the right migration path," Baker said.

Baker说：“在没到合适时间的时候，机构并不想升级，五年是一段很长的时间，这给了他们找到正确迁移路径更多的选择。”

Baker admitted that the new release is relatively light on new packages and features, mainly due to Canonical's work on getting the software ready for long-term usage.

Baker承认，新版本是相对较轻的新包和功能，主要是由于Canonical公司为使得软件可供长期使用。

The company has done a lot of interoperability work with other hardware and software vendors, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Cisco and cloud providers such as Amazon, Joyent, Hewlett-Packard and others.

该公司与其他硬件和软件供应商已经做了大量的互操作，如高级微设备，思科和云供应商如亚马逊，Joyent，惠普等等。

The package includes the latest version of the OpenStack cloud-hosting software, called Icehouse, [due to be released Thursday][4].

该包包括最新的OpenStack云托管软件，称为冰室[定于星期四发布][4].

This is notable in that OpenStack itself will only support each release through the next two releases, [a duration that has been until now about 18 months][5].

值得注意的是OpenStack本身只会通过接下来的下两个版本来对每个版本进行支持[一直到现在大约18个月][5].

Ubuntu 14.04 is also the first to include Docker,[a Linux container technology that provides a lighter-weight alternative to running full virtual machines][6].

这也是Ubuntu 14.04第一次包含Docker，[一个开源的Linux应用容器引擎，支持轻量级运行完整的虚拟机][6]

This is also the first edition to include XFS, a high performance 64-bit journaling file system first developed by SGI (Silicon Graphics). Canonical competitor Red Hat [plans to use XFS][7] as the default file system for the next edition of its Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) distribution.

这也包括XFS第一版，一个最初由SGI(硅图形)公司开发的高性能的64位日志文件系统。Canonical公司的竞争对手Red Hat[计划使用XFS][7]作为小红帽Linux企业版(RHEL)的默认文件系统。

Red Hat also includes Docker and OpenStack in RHEL.

小红帽Linux企业版中同样包含Docker和OpenStack。

Canonical has also equipped Ubuntu to work more effectively with solid-state disks (SSDs). Ubuntu 14.04 comes with Linux kernel version 3.13, [released in January][8]. Linux 3.13 includes a new technology called Multi-Queue Block Layer, which improves read-write performance on SSD disks [by spreading the work across multiple cores][9].

同样的，Canonical公司的Ubuntu也将更有效的支持固态硬盘(SSDs)。Ubuntu 14.04配备了Linux 3.13 内核，[一月份发布的][8]。Linux 3.13包括一个称为多队列块层的新技术，通过将作业分发到多核提高了SSD磁盘读写性能。
