"Performance, refinement, maintainability, technical debt, improving quality" and "we’re going to keep racing forward" to characterize Ubuntu 14.04's development cycle
================================================================================
Ubuntu 13.10 was released yesterday, Ubuntu 13.10 allowing users to utilize an up-to-date optimized Ubuntu release with gains in agility, fluidity and an overall solid look & feel.

Starting of today, the natural flow of the developers is Ubuntu 14.04-centric, version being an LTS and, therefore, receiving a special treatment following Ubuntu's values and strategies.

**Mark Shuttleworth** [announced][1] hours ago the new name of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Trusty Tahr, interesting article presenting the focus on the 14.04 LTS version, too.

Among the to-be-followed directions, Mark Shuttleworth talked about and listed performance, refinement, maintainability and technical debt, while adopting a more conservative approach in creating, shaping and delivering Trusty, "it would be entirely appropriate for us to make **conservative choices**".

The conservative nature of Ubuntu 14.04's development is natural, the next LTS will feature five years of support, while pleasing both users and companies interested in the most stable Ubuntu experience.

Moreover, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS is to witness:

- "we will be providing OpenStack I, J and K on 14.04 for LTS deployments"
- "on the desktop, 13.10 has benefited greatly from the fact that it has a team just focused on improving quality. We’ll do the same again and more for 14.04"
- "on the mobile front, we’re going to keep racing forward, the platform is too new for an LTS"

The in-depth decisions about what, where, how, when related to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS are to be planned, discussed and refined in the upcoming [virtual Ubuntu Developer][2] Summit, video-session based event happening during **November 19th - November 21st **2013, event fully open for participation and completely open to interested users, third-party developers and teams seeking to learn about all Ubuntu layers and areas directly as presented by Ubuntu developers, designers, leaders, etc.

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS will not feature convergence capabilities, yet, the work continues with vigorous plans and according features in the 14.04 cycle, too, "we won’t get there in one cycle but given the pace of improvement of the phone and tablet in the last month I think **it’s going to be a fantastic cycle there"**.
