**今天是Ubuntu 13.10 发布的日子。经过6个月紧锣密鼓地开发，‘Saucy Salamander’ 终于可供下载了。**

With a growing user base of some 20 million plus, every update to Ubuntu, no matter how trivial it turns out to be, commands attention. This release is no exception.  
超过两千万的用户基础，Ubuntu的每次更新，无论最终变动的结果多么得琐碎、微小，都能引起关注。这次发布也不例外。

But is it an essential upgrade?

## “Ubuntu 13.10 Is Boring” - The Internet ##
## “Ubuntu 13.10 乏味之极” - 网络 ##  

我见过许多人-科技记者，博主，还有评论家，用“令人讨厌的”字眼来形容Ubuntu 13.10。  
I’ve seen many people – tech journalists, bloggers and arm-chair critics alike – describe Ubuntu 13.10 as a ‘boring’ release.

诚然，Saucy Salamander比之先前的版本并没有为桌面版添加多少新的特色，但是新的版本确实变动了，也改善了，只不过
大多数变动相较而言很小。  
While it’s true that the Saucy Salamander brings fewer new features to the desktop than previous releases have, there are definite improvements and changes to be found – it’s just that most of them are relatively minor.

Emphasis on ‘most‘.  
重点在‘most’。

**A Dash Full of Things**  
**工具箱花样繁多**

*How much of this is actually useful?*  
*这些东西究竟有多大用处呢？*

Unity’s new Smart Scopes feature is the big draw of this release. It super-charges the Dash with semantic intelligence, drawing together information from a wide range of online sources for every search you make.  
Unity的新的 搜索建议 功能是新版本中大的亮点。你的每一次搜索，都会把大范围在线资源的相关信息整合到一起，然后使用语义智能充实工具箱。  

*Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Wikipedia, Weather Channel, SoundCloud* - over 50 web services are queried.  
*Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Wikipedia, Weather Channel, SoundCloud* - 信息来源超过50个网站  

> ‘…unintelligible, irrelevant mess.’  
> ‘…莫名其妙，乱七八糟。’ 

字面上貌似这个功能挺有用的：按下tab键，，你就可以绕过浏览器找到任何你想搜寻的东西，随便一些东西，然后从桌面上就可以浏览结果。
On paper the feature sounds helpful: with the tap of a key you can bypass your browser and find whatever it is you’re looking for, wherever it may be, right from the desktop.

In practice it’s less of a help and more of a hindrance. With so many web services offering results for a search term – however innocuous it might be – the Dash ends up resembling a wall painted in unintelligible, irrelevant mess.  
事实上，帮助挺少，阻碍倒是不小。那么多的web服务都给一个搜索的关键字条目提供结果 - 无论看起来有多无碍 - 
都导致工具箱充斥着莫名其妙、乱七八糟、不相关的东西。 

> ‘In its current form the feature fails to trump the browser experience.’  
> ‘以当前这种形式，该功能还超越不了浏览器体验’

There is an attempt at bring order to this chaos. Results are ‘grouped’ by theme, e.g. Shopping, Music, Video. The Results Filter also helps give some control over the flood of info.  
也不是没有尝试过结束这种混乱，代之以秩序井然。给查找结果分门别类，比如，购物，音乐，视频。由结果过滤器来控制泛滥的信息。

But, quite honestly, in its current form the feature fails to trump the browser experience. Google is smarter at knowing what it is I’m trying to find, and presents results in a format that is, visually, easier to browse and filter.  
但是，坦白说，以当前这种形式，该功能还超越不了浏览器体验。谷歌就比较聪明，知道自己要找什么，把结果以一种易于浏览，易于过滤的形式呈现出来。

Ubuntu developers say that **results will become more relevant** as the service ‘learns’ from users, so there is hope.  
Ubuntu开发者称**搜索结果会变得越来越相关的**，因为该服务可以从用户那里自主学习。让我们拭目以待。


Turn Scopes Off
关闭范围建议功能
![](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-07-at-12.59.jpg)

*Each Scope can be turned off individually*
*每一个范围都可以单独关闭* 

关闭“搜索建议”功能很简单，听从我的建议，就可以单独关闭给你带来混乱结果的范围。这样你就能够继续使用该功能，同时又过滤掉不相干的东西。  
Switching the ‘Smart Scopes’ feature off entirely is simple enough, though my tip would be to individually disable the Scopes returning results of no relevance to you. That way you can continue using the feature, but filter out the noise.

**Indicator Keyboard**
**指示灯键盘**

Whether you need it or not, a new ‘Keyboard Indicator’ has been added to Ubuntu to make switching between multiple input languages easier.  
无论你需要与否，新的‘指示灯键盘’已经添加到Ubuntu中，该功能使得在多种语言之间的切换更容易。  

To turn off the applet head to Text Entry Settings and uncheck the box next to ‘Show Current Input Source in Menu Bar’.
可以在Text Entry Settings上面找到该功能入口，关闭它，然后取消紧挨着‘Show Current Input Source in Menu Bar’勾选框。

A login/sign-up page for Ubuntu One has been added to the Ubuntu installer, saving the need to configure accounts after installation.
登陆、注册页面也加到了Ubuntu安装程序里头，安装后就不需要再配置账号了。  

**Performance**  
**性能**

With Unity 7 now sticking around for a lot longer than originally planned (it’ll be default in 14.04 LTS, due in April) some much needed maintenance has gone on.  
Unity 7比原先预计



While I haven’t run any benchmarks myself, those who have done so note there are notable performance gains arriving with this release.

The Unity Dash is especially responsive, while Compiz leaves less weight on system resources.

**Applications**

Although the Ubuntu Software Center is on hand for all your application needs, the latest versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, LibreOffice and Shotwell come pre-installed out of the box.

The Ubuntu repositories are also stocked with newer versions of other popular apps, like the [Geary mail client][2] and popular image editor GIMP.

Finally, [GTK3 apps now look better under Ubuntu’s default theme][3]. 

## Summary ##

> A solid, reliable release – more of a footnote than the start of a new chapter

Ubuntu 13.10 is a solid, reliable release that cements its position as the ‘go to’ Linux distro for new users and seasoned pros alike.

At face value this release does seem like more of a footnote in Ubuntu’s history than the start of a whole new chapter. A handful of small, iterative changes, including a more performant Unity desktop, certainly make it a worthwhile upgrade – but far from an essential one.
