1938年10月22曰，纽约市皇后区阿斯托里亚的一间公寓内，专利代理人卡尔逊（Chester Carlson）和他的助手，奥地利物理学家柯乃伊（Otto Kornei）利用一个上午的时间制作了世界上第一张静电复印件(卡尔逊经过3年研究，在1938年成功实现世界上第一个静电复印实验——译者注)，从此开创了计算机的新时代！这是一个改变世界的时刻，这是一个激动人心的时刻！然后他们就去吃午餐了:D

75年来，复印产业成了美国公司的中流砥柱。即使在平板电脑和PDF大行其道的今天，去年一年时间，“多功能打印机”销量为1900万台，交易额为309亿美元(来自顾能公司的数据)。你也许忘了上次使用打印机是在什么时候了，但IDC分析师Angèle Boyd指出去年全球打印了3万亿张纸，其中１万亿张来自美国。在一些公司里，一个员工每个月打印300到400张纸是再平常不过的事了。打印机生意保持如此令人吃惊的强大，其革命性已经远超当年卡尔逊刚发明模拟式静电复印机的时候了。


静电打印机提升了企业的生产力，增强了商务交流。顾能公司负责调查、绘图和打印业务的副总裁Ken Weilerstein指出，大部分白领的工作任务就是以各种各样的形式阅读和创建文档。Tim Burners-Lee在1991年将超文本技术引入到互联网，用于链接不同计算机内部的文档。

Ken Weilerstein说：“打印机改变了人们处理文档的方式，在人类的办公史上，这可是一件大事。”

###施乐的崛起

施乐(Xerox)称得上是最有名的打印机公司，在打印机市场持很大的占有率。就像人们谈搜索时会说“上网google一下”，谈到打印时会说“我需要xerox（复印）这份文档”，施乐公司已经渗入人们的日常生活中了。在科技领域，20世纪70年代，施乐由于在帕罗奥多研究中心（PARC）发明的用户图形界面和鼠标而声名远扬，乔帮主当年参观PARC后将很多点子用到了他的苹果机上（其中一个就是PARC研发的图形用户界面——译者注）。另外，激光打印机也借鉴了卡尔逊的发明。

刚开始，施乐并不叫施乐。位于纽约市康涅狄格州罗切斯特市的哈洛伊德（Haloid）公司看中静电打印技术，收购了卡尔逊的这项发明，之后才更名为“施乐”(在这中间，哈洛伊德还曾更名为“哈洛伊德施乐”——译者注)。

我们继续卡尔逊的故事，这位发明家和专利代理人对手工复印法律文件感到无比厌烦，他认为世上肯定有一种复印方法能让他摆脱油墨复写纸，这种传统上使用湿纸张和水的复印方法处理起来又乱又慢，拍照处理的代价还巨昂贵（当时世界上只有基于银盐照相直接影印的复印方法——译者注）。 施乐公司档案管理者，一个历史性人物，Ray Brewer（不好意思没能找到你的中文名字:D），他说卡尔逊的这个涉及锌片锌粉（估计是作为感光材料——译者注）的发明即简单又容易复制。

（Weilerstein解释说，静电复印的处理过程就是这么个回事：一张纸放在光源底下，光源会扫描整张纸，记下复印原件的信息。光线通过一组透镜照到涂有光敏材料的静电成像鼓上，于是物理反应就发生了。成像鼓被曝光部分的会产生静电荷，结果就是复印原件的信息被复制到鼓上。之后成像鼓转移位置，静电荷所在的地方会吸引增色剂微粒，从而在鼓上画出原件图像。然后成像鼓将增色剂转移到一张被铁加热过的白纸上，成像鼓回到原位置，多余的增色剂被刮下来，复印完成，接着进入下一个循环。）

或许这个过程太简单了点。当卡尔逊在庆祝他们的突破时，他的助手柯乃伊并没有看到这一点。当柯乃伊与卡尔逊的合同到期后，他们就失去了联系。“柯乃伊没看到卡氽逊发明的意义”，Brewer说道。柯乃伊将会终身后悔。**后来卡尔逊给了柯乃伊100股施乐的股票，而柯乃伊马上就把它们卖了，为此他少嫌了至少100万美元。**

多年来，卡尔逊向多家公司推销他的专利，包括IBM和柯达，但是没人理他。Brewer认为，这是因为卡尔逊只是一个研发人员，而不是一个销售人员：“卡尔逊推销他的专利的方式非常枯燥和专业，这种方式对于将他的专利推销到市场没有任何帮助，即使是技术工程师也被卡尔逊的表达搞得迷迷糊糊”。

卡尔逊的大突破发生在1946年，哈洛伊德公司老大John Dessauer读到了关于卡尔逊发明的文章。哈洛伊德本来是做照相纸的，“当时的照相领域发展非常迅速”，Brewer说。1948年，哈洛伊德为卡尔逊的发明找了一个比较容易记住的名字：静电复印技术（electrophotography）。后来改为施乐复印技术（xerography），取希腊词根“xeros（干）”和“graphos（写）”组成的新词。

在20世纪50到60年代之间，施乐打印机成为办公必备用品。这项改革节省了时间的金钱。以前，复印文档的唯一方法就是使用直接影印机，那是相当杂乱和昂贵的操作，更糟糕的是，那种油墨纸一次最多只能复制两份。假如你想复印更多份，你必须重新打印一份出来，“并且秘书和领导希望所有的复印件都一模一样，”Brewer又出来讲话了。这就是施乐复印术的又一个好处：多份一模一样的复印件。在email和即时通信出来之前，这种复印术为部门间交流提供机会。施乐复印术催生了备忘录、办公简讯以及生日贺卡等新鲜玩意儿。

914型复印机是施乐公司最成功的产品。在60年代到70年代初，施乐共卖掉超过20万台这个型号的复印机，《财富》杂志将它评为“美国史上最成功的产品”。Weilerstein称施乐为“你后悔没买它的股票”的公司。

###现代计算机Era

This Mad Men era would come to a close in the 1980s as PCs began replacing typewriters. Carlson's invention would also be used to create the laser printer, which obviated single-function copiers. As a result, no one in the industry calls Xerox's machines copiers anymore. Instead, they are known as "multifunction printers."

That wasn't the only threat to Xerox's business. By the 1970s, Japanese competitors were offering their own cheaper version of Xerox's copiers. Xerox lost its effective monopoly, but managed to stay on the cutting edge of technology, Weilerstein says, by developing its own laser printer business. Then in 1990, Xerox introduced Docutech, a technology that let you turn a printer effectively into a printing press. Xerox scored another coup in 2000 with iGen, a color laser printer that could spit out 100 pages a minute. "By the mid-2000s, they didn't have anything exclusive at all," Weilerstein says, "and they began suffering economically."

Xerox wasn't hit as hard as its Rochester neighbor, Eastman Kodak, which is now a [shadow of its former self][1].

Partially that's because — unlike film — printing paper documents remains a lucrative business. There are sectors of the economy — including the federal government — where employees still print a few thousand pages a month. Weilerstein acknowledges that the use of print will continue to decline over time. "It's probably a generational factor," he says. However "it isn't really disappearing."

Bolstered by the continued need for multifunction printers, Xerox has the opportunity to reinvent itself as a provider of primarily digital documents and services. The company laid the groundwork for such a move by embracing the managed print services business in the last decade. MPS essentially outsources the printing aspect of the office and gives IT departments one less task to monitor.

However, since paper printing is on a long-term downward trend, Xerox is trying to anticipate where the market will go next. "Now the question is what will they do after this," says Weilerstein. "They will take this idea of a service that manages your printers and turn that into a service that handles how you handle docs in digital form."

" I think there's a great desire among IT [departments] to get rid of paper," says the IDC's Boyd. "A lot of people, including Xerox, are actively trying to help them."

Weilerstein's view is that since all communication is basically documents, Xerox has a chance to become a leader in "managed content services." Such services would help organizations cut down on the use of print. Though paper is still a useful communications medium, many printed pages are symptoms of problems involving poor interconnection between the different sources of information where workers obtain information and the different destinations to which they must apply it," Weilerstein wrote in a recent white paper on the subject.

MCS would address the advertising orders that a broadcast network still receives by fax or provide a means to let a chemical manufacturer's employees scan their handwritten notes into a searchable digital archive.

Carlson's Legacy

In promoting a largely paperless future, Xerox would not only transition its business but help cut down on needless waste. However, the company has lots of competition on the document front, most notably from Adobe, the inventor of the Portable Document Format (PDF).

Adobe, whose legacy is in desktop printing rather than hardware, appears to have a natural advantage over Xerox. Apple aside, it's rare that a company associated with the invention of an old technology manages to also become a leader in the technology that replaces it.

Yet even if Xerox ultimately fails, Carlson's contribution to tech history is assured, if a bit obscure to most. A serial inventor, Carlson didn't have much to show for his other ideas — including a raincoat with gutters and a shoe-cleaning machine — but his one great invention is a testament to how the market rewards perseverance and vision. His death was an illustration of how little we sometimes know of the inner life of public figures.

Almost exactly 30 years after Carlson and Kornei slaved over their invention in that Astoria apartment, Carlson took a trip back to New York from his Rochester home for a business meeting. Finding he had some down time, he ducked into a movie theater to catch He Who Rides a Tiger featuring Tom Bell and Judi Dench. After the movie, an usher saw Carlson, who appeared to be dozing in his seat. He hadn't. Carlson succumbed to a heart attack — his second that year.

He died with an estimated fortune of $150 million, making him one of the wealthiest men in the country in 1968. That estimate was wrong, though. Carlson had actually given away much of his wealth by then. As he told his wife, Carlson had a curious ambition for a business titan. He wanted to "die a poor man."
